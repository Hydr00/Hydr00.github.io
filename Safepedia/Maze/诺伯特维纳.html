			<h1>LEVEL4-Cybernetics</h1>
			<p>Norbert Wiener, a famous mathematician in the 20th century, was intelligent from an early age. He was able to read and write at the age of three and graduated from college at the age of fourteen.
				<p>A few years later, he passed his doctoral thesis and became a doctor of science from Harvard University in the United States. At the doctoral award ceremony, the executive chairman was surprised to see Wiener with a childish face, so he asked his age face to face. Wiener was a mathematical prodigy, and his answer was ingenious: "the cube of my age this year is a four-digit number, and the fourth power of my age is a six-digit number." these two numbers, Just ten numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are all used. This means that all the numbers bow to me and wish me an earth-shaking career in the field of mathematics in the future. "</p>
				<p>As soon as Wiener said this, all four were surprised, and everyone was fascinated by his wonderful question. The whole meeting was talking about his<span style="color: #1E90FF;"> Age </span>problem.</p>
