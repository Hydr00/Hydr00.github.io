		<h2>What is a hacker?</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>	<b>Hacker</b>，Usually refers to a person with a high understanding of computer science, programming, and design.</p>
		<p> Generally refers to people who are good at IT technology, computer scientists. Hacker is proficient in a variety of programming languages and operating systems, and has grown with the development of computers and networks. The word "hacker" is transliterated from English Hacker. The English word itself has no obvious commendatory or derogatory meaning. In English application, it should be judged according to the context. Its original meaning is similar to the words such as knife catcher, shooter, expert and so on, which are often mentioned in Chinese dialogue.</p>
		<p> The original meaning of hackers is to use axes to cut wood workers, the first introduction into the computer circle can be traced back to the 1960s. Brian Harvey, a computer professor at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote that students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at (MIT) were usually divided into two groups. One was that tool, meant good students with grades of Grade A. The other is the so-called hacker, that is, students who often skip classes and love to sleep in class, but who are energetic and like to engage in extracurricular activities at night.</p>
		<h2>Level</h2>
		<hr>
		<p> The term hacker is usually defined outside the circle or in the media as a computer expert who specializes in hacking into other people's systems to commit illegal acts. But this kind of person belongs to the lower level cracker (hacker) in the eyes of hacker. If the hacker is a bomb maker, then the hacker is a terrorist.</P>
		<p> With the development of the times, more and more hackers have appeared on the network. They will only invade, scan everywhere with scanners, blow people up with IP bombs, invade and destroy aimlessly, and they are not conducive to the development of computer technology. On the contrary, it is harmful to the security of the network and causes network paralysis, which brings huge economic and mental losses to people. The following is a list of different types or levels of hackers:</p>
		<p> 1.Hacker (term), an in-depth technical study of computer security experts.</p>
		<p> 2.Hacker (computer security) or biscuit, access to computer system security system failure.</p>
		<p> 3.Hackers (enthusiasts) to innovative customization or combination of retail electronic and computer equipment.</p>
		<p> 4.Hackers (programmer subculture), an anti-authoritarian approach to software development, is accompanied by the free software movement.</p>
		<h2>Origin</h2>
		<hr>
		<p> The word "hacker" is a transliteration of English Hacker. The word existed as early as Shakespeare, but the first time people really understood it was after the advent of computers. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the earliest meaning of the word "hack" was chopping, which is easily reminiscent of computers being hacked by others. So the Oxford English Dictionary explains that the word "Hacker" involves the meaning of a computer: "people who use their computer skills to try to access computer files or networks without authorization."</p>
		<p> The earliest computers were born at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946, and the earliest hackers appeared at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. So does Bell Labs. The original hackers were generally senior technicians who were keen to challenge, advocate freedom and advocate the sharing of information.</p>
		<p> Since 1994, the rapid development of the Internet in China and even the world has provided people with convenience, freedom and unlimited wealth. Politics, military, economy, science and technology, education, culture and other aspects are becoming more and more networked, and gradually become a part of people's life and entertainment. It can be said that the information age has arrived, information has become the third resource to maintain human society in addition to material and energy, it is an important medium in the future life. With the popularity of computers and the rapid development of Internet technology, hackers also appeared.</p>
		<h2>Difference</h2>
		<hr>
		<p> Hackers, which originated in the early days of English hacker, were commendatory in the computer world in the United States. They are highly skilled computer experts, especially programmers, as a general term.</p>
		<p> Honker (A person or thing that honks) refers to the maintenance of national interests, not the use of network technology to invade their own national computers, but "to maintain justice, win glory for their own country hackers."</p>
		<p> Lanke, freedom of belief, patriotic hackers, use their own power to maintain the peace of the network.</p>
		<p> Cracker, is engaged in malicious cracking of business software, malicious intrusion into other people's websites, and so on. A computer system / software intruder.</p>
		<h2>Famous people</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Representative people</h3>
		<p>1.Kevin David Mitnick，Born in Los Angeles in 1964.Some critics have called him the world's "number one computer hacker". The "famous man" is only 50 years old, but his legendary hacking experience has shocked the world.</p>
		<p>2.Adrian Lamo:One of the five most famous hackers in history. Lamo specializes in large organizations, such as hacking into Microsoft and the New York Times. Lamo likes to use the network of coffee shops, Kinko stores or libraries to hack, so he gets a nickname: hackers who don't go home. Lamo often discovers and exploits security vulnerabilities. He usually tells the business about the loopholes.</p>
		<p>3.Jonathan James:One of the five most famous hackers in history. James was already notorious at the age of 16 because he became the first minor to be jailed for hacking. He later admitted that he liked to joke, wander around and meet challenges.</p>
		<p>4.Robert Tappan Morrisgeek.One of the five most famous hackers in American history. Morris's father was a former NSA scientist named Robert Morris. Robert is the creator of the Morris worm, which is thought to be the first worm to spread over the Internet. That's why he became the first person to be sued under the computer Deception and abuse Act of 1986.</p>
		<p>5.Kevin Lee Poulsen:Born in 1965 in Pasadena, the United States. He often uses his vest, "Dark Dante (Dark Dante," and is famous for attacking the KIIS-FM phone line that entered Radio Los Angeles, which won him a Porsche.</p>
		<h3>Major achievements</h3>
		<p>1.Richard Stallman--Traditional big hacker，Stallman was hired as a programmer in the artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1971.</p>
		<p>2.Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie--Programmer for the computer science operations team at Bell Labs. The two invented the Unix operating system in 1969.</p>
		<p>3.John Draper(famous as Captain Crunch)--Invented making toll-free calls with a plastic whistle.</p>
		<p>4.Mark Abene(famous as Phiber Optik)--Inspired countless teenagers across the United States to "learn" how the internal telephone system works in the United States</p>
		<p>5.Robert Morris--Cornell University graduate, inadvertently spread the first Internet virus "worm" in 1988</p>
		<p>6.In 2002, Christmas came early for Kevin Mitnick, a once-notorious computer hacker. It was a happy year for Kevin Mitnick. Not only was there complete freedom (from then on, being free to surf the Internet, not being able to access the Internet, for hackers, was another kind of prison life). Moreover, he has launched a best-selling book, The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security, which has just been completed. The book was a great success and became the first shot of renewed attention at Kevin Mitnick.</p>
		<p>7.There are many definitions of the word "hacker" in Jargon File, most of which involve superb programming skills, a strong desire to solve problems and overcome limitations. If you want to know how to be a hacker, then well, only two things are important. (attitude and technology)</p>
		<h2>Historical significance</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>For a long time, there has been a shared cultural community of expert programmers and web masters, dating back to the first time-sharing minicomputer and the earliest ARPAnet experiments in the 1960s. Participants in the culture coined the word "hacker". Hackers built Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today. The hackers set up Usenet. The hackers made it work. If you are part of this culture, if you have contributed to it, and if other people in the circle know who you are and call you a hacker, then you are a hacker.</p>
		<p>The spirit of hacking is not limited to the cultural circle of software hackers. Some people also treat other things like electronics and music as hackers-in fact, you can find it in any higher level of science and art. Software hackers identify their peers in other areas and call them hackers-some claim that hackers are actually independent of their work. But in this article, we focus on the technology and attitude of software hackers and the shared cultural traditions that invented the word "hacker."</p>
