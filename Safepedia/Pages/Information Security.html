		<h1>Information Security</h1>
		<hr />
		<p>Information Security</p>
		<h2>Definition</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Information security refers to the technical and managed security protection adopted for the data processing system to protect computer hardware, software and data from being damaged, changed and exposed by accidental or malicious reasons. This contains the concept of the layer, in which the computer hardware can be regarded as the physical level, the software can be regarded as the operational level, and then the data level; It also contains the concept of attributes, where breakage involves usability, changes involve integrity, and disclosure involves confidentiality.</p>
		<h2>Classification</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>1. Hardware security: that is, the security of network hardware and storage media. It is necessary to protect these hard facilities from damage and be able to work properly.</p>
		<p>2. Software security: that is, the computer and its network r all kinds of software will not be tampered with or destroyed, will not be illegally operated or misoperated, the function will not be invalid, will not be illegally copied.</p>
		<p>3. Operation service security: that is, each information system in the network can operate normally and communicate information through the network normally. Through the monitoring of the operation status of all kinds of equipment in the network system, it is found that the unsafe factors can alarm in time and take measures to change the unsafe state to ensure the normal operation of the network system.</p>
		<p>4. Data security: that is, the security of the existence and circulation of data in the network. To protect the data in the network from tampering, illegal addition and deletion, replication, decryption, display, use and so on. It is the most fundamental purpose of ensuring network security.</p>
		<h2>Countermeasures of Information Security</h2>
		<hr />
		<h3>1. Security technology</h3>
		<p>In order to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and controllability of information, relevant technical means must be adopted. These technical means are the intuitive part of the information security system, any aspect of the weak will produce great danger. Therefore, we should make reasonable arrangements and interact with each other to make it an organic whole. The specific technical introduction is as follows:</p>
		<p>(1) Encryption and decryption technology. In the process of transmission or storage, the encryption and decryption of information data can be carried out. The typical encryption system can use symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption.</p>
		<p>(2) VPN technology. VPN is a virtual private network, which establishes a temporary and secure connection through a public network (usually the Internet). It is a secure and stable tunnel through a chaotic public network. Usually VPN is an extension of the intranet, which can help remote users, corporate branches, business partners and suppliers to establish trusted secure connections with the intranet of the company, and ensure the secure transmission of data.</p>
		<p>(3) Firewall technology. Firewall can be said to be an access control product in a sense. It sets up obstacles between the internal network and the insecure external network, prevents the external illegal access to the internal resources, and the internal unsafe access to the external. </p>
		<p>(4) intrusion detection technology. Intrusion detection technology IDS is a reasonable supplement to the firewall, helps the system to defend against network attacks, expands the security management ability of system administrators, and improves the integrity of information security infrastructure. Human intrusion detection technology collects information from several key points in the computer network system and analyzes it to check whether there are any violations of security policies and signs of attack in the network.</p>
		<p>(5) Security audit technology. Includes log audit and behavior audit.</p>
		<p>Log audit assists administrators to view the network log after the attack, so as to evaluate the rationality of network configuration and the effectiveness of security policy, and trace and analyze the trajectory of security attack. And provide the means for real-time defense.</p>
		<p>Through the audit of the network behavior of employees or users, we can confirm the standardization of behavior and ensure the security of management.</p>
		<h3>2. Safety management</h3>
		<p>Only to establish a sound safety management system. Information security management will be implemented from beginning to end in all aspects of information system management, enterprise information security can be truly realized. Specific technologies include the following:</p>
		<p>(1) to carry out information security education and improve security awareness. The level of employees' awareness of information security is a decisive factor in the final and successful implementation of an enterprise information security system. According to incomplete statistics, threats to information security are mainly internal (80 per cent), in addition to external threats (20 per cent). In enterprises, information security education can be carried out in various forms. For example, through training, publicity and other forms, appropriate reward and punishment measures can be adopted to strengthen the attention of technical personnel to information security. To enhance the safety concept of users; 2 carry out targeted publicity and education of safety awareness, at the same time remind and urge the improvement of users with security problems, and gradually improve the security awareness of users.</p>
		<p>(2) to establish a perfect organization and management system. A complete enterprise information system security management system should first establish a perfect organizational system, that is, to establish a security decision-making body composed of administrative leaders, IT technical directors, information security directors, system user representatives and security consultants. Complete the development and issuance of information security management standards and the establishment of information security management organization, unify and coordinate the project implementation process from the management level and the implementation level. Overcome the interference of human factors in the process of implementation, ensure the implementation of information security measures and the continuous improvement of the information security system itself.</p>
		<p>(3) backup important data in time. In the actual operating environment, data backup and recovery is very important. Even if the security measures are strengthened from the aspects of prevention, protection, encryption, detection and so on, it is impossible to ensure that the system will not have security failure. Important data should be backed up to ensure the integrity of the data. It is best for enterprises to adopt a unified backup system and backup software to back up all the data that needs to be backed up incrementally and fully in accordance with the backup strategy. There should be special personnel responsible for and special personnel inspection to ensure the strict conduct and reliability and integrity of data backup, and regularly arrange data recovery tests, verify their availability, and adjust data backup and recovery strategies in a timely manner. At present, the virtual storage technology has become more and more mature, a set of storage devices can be installed in different places for remote backup, if you do not have this condition, we must ensure that the backup media are stored in different places, and all backup media must be kept by special personnel.</p>
		<h2>Methods of Information Security</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>From the point of view of information security attributes, each information security level has a corresponding disposal method:</p>
		<p>1. Physical security: refers to the protection of physical equipment of networks and information systems, the main protection methods are interference processing, electromagnetic shielding, data verification, redundancy and system backup.</p>
		<p>2. Operational security: refers to the protection of the operational process and status of networks and information systems, The main protection methods are firewall and physical isolation, risk analysis and vulnerability scanning, emergency response, virus prevention, access control, security audit, intrusion detection, source routing filtering, downgrade use, data backup and so on.</p>
		<p>3. Data security: refers to the protection of information in the process of data collection, processing, storage, retrieval, transmission, exchange, display and diffusion, so as to ensure the authorized use of information at the data processing level. Not to be illegally impersonated, stolen, tampered with, denied, the main protection methods are encryption, authentication, asymmetric key, integrity verification, authentication, digital signature and secret sharing and so on.</p>
		<p>4. Content security: refers to the selective blocking of the flow of information within the network in order to ensure the controllable flow of information. The main disposal means are ciphertext analysis or morphological analysis, the cutting of flow information, the blocking of information, the replacement of information, the filtering of information and the control of the system.</p>
		<p>5. Information confrontation: refers to the hiding and protection of the authenticity of information, or attack and analysis in the process of using information, The main disposal means are to eliminate important local information, increase the ability to obtain information and eliminate the uncertainty of information and so on.</p>
		<h2>Basic requirements of Information Security</h2>
		<hr />
		<h3>1. Confidentiality of data. </h3>
		<p>Because the system is unable to confirm whether unauthorized users intercept data on the network. This requires the use of a means of confidential processing of the data. Data encryption is used to achieve this goal, encrypted data can ensure that in the process of transmission, use and conversion will not be illegally obtained by third parties. After the data is encrypted and transformed, the plaintext is changed into ciphertext. Only the authorized legitimate users use their own key, the ciphertext can be restored to plaintext by decryption algorithm. Data confidentiality can be said to be the basic guarantee of many security measures, which can be divided into network transmission confidentiality and data storage confidentiality.</p>
		<h3>2. Integrity of data</h3>
		<p>The integrity of data is a feature that the data cannot be changed without authorization, that is, only the person who is allowed can modify the data, and can judge whether the data has been modified or not. The data in the memory or the data transmitted over the network must be in exactly the same form as the content before its last modification or transmission. Its purpose is to ensure that the data on the information system is in a complete and undamaged state so that the data will not be changed, destroyed and lost by intentional or unintentional events because of the process of storage and transmission. The system needs a way to confirm that the data has not changed during this process. This change may result from natural disasters, intentional and unintentional human behaviour. Obviously, it is not enough to use only one method to ensure the integrity of data. On the basis of the application of data encryption technology, the fault emergency plan and a variety of preventive techniques should be used comprehensively. This is achieved by means such as archiving, backup, verification, crash dump, and fault precursor analysis.</p>
		<h3>3. Availability of data</h3>
		<p>The availability of data is a feature that can be accessed by authorized entities and used on demand, that is, an attacker cannot occupy all resources and hinder the work of the licensee. If a legitimate user needs to get system or network services, the system and network can not provide normal services. This is the same as the documents are locked in the safe and the switches and passwords are confused and cannot be removed.</p>
		<h2>Classic cases of Information Security</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>At 4: 00 p.m. on August 14, 2003, there was a sudden power outage in most of North America. No one expected that this stop would take more than 20 hours. MostafaMehrabani, the global chief information officer of McGraw Hill, which happens to be the publication day of McGraw Hill's BusinessWeek magazine, tells the story of the blackout in New York. "at that time, the situation was very urgent, many people kept asking about the business of the company, and the next day, whether BusinessWeek could be published properly was a matter of widespread concern. In fact, at the moment of the blackout, we had moved all of our publishing business to New Jersey, where we had a spare set of equipment. "our power system is stable and backup generators can work without electricity for several days, so our publishing work has not been affected in any way. The next day, Businessweek was published as scheduled. " As an information service provider, McGraw Hill has become the most important thing to protect information security. For small and medium-sized enterprises, setting up a data backup center for cost reasons is not the most appropriate solution, but it costs almost zero to do a data backup at a distance from their own computer. Many companies do not yet have this awareness.</p>
