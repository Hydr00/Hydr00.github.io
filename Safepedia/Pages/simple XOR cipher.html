	<h1>simple XOR cipher</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>XOR is a logical analysis type of two operators, symbolized as XOR or EOR. Unlike general logic or OR, it is true when the two values are the same and the values are different. XOR cryptography (simple XOR cipher) is a simple encryption algorithm in cryptography, which refers to the XOR operation of information to achieve the purpose of encryption and decryption. According to this logic, each character of the text serial can be encrypted by bitwise XOR with a given key. If you want to decrypt, you only need to perform a bitwise XOR operation between the encrypted result and the key again.</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>XOR operation (XOR) is an important bit operation based on binary in computer programming language, which has important practical value for improving program readability and running efficiency. XOR operation has the common properties of exchange law, combination law, reflexivity law, pairing and so on, which is widely used in parity discrimination, error correction, network coding, information encryption, image processing and so on.</p>
	<p>XOR cipher is an algorithm encrypted by XOR operation, which operates according to the following principles: </p>
	<p>Where is the symbol of logical XOR (XOR) operation.</p>

	<p>For example, the string "Wiki" (8-bit ASCII:01010111 01101001 01101011 01101001) can be encrypted with key 11110011 as follows:</p>

	<p>XOR operators are often part of more complex encryption algorithms. For itself, if you use a repetitive key, you can use frequency analysis to crack this simple XOR password. If the content of the message is guessed or known, the key will be leaked. The main reason why XOR passwords are worth using is that they are easy to implement and cost less to calculate. Simple repeating XOR encryption is sometimes used to hide information without special security. </p>
	<p>If the key is random (not repeated) and is the same length as the message, the XOR password is more secure. When a key stream is generated by a pseudorandom number generator, the result is a stream password. If the key is truly random, the result is a one-time codebook, which is theoretically unbreakable. In any part of these passwords, the key operator is vulnerable to known plaintext attacks because plaintext ciphertext = key.</p>
	<h2>Frequency analysis</h2>
	<hr >
	<p>Frequency analysis is a method of decomposing the frequency components of functions, waveforms, or signals in mathematics, physics, and signal processing to obtain the spectrum. The typical distribution of letters in an English text. Weaker passwords show this distribution and are deciphered by cryptographers. In the distribution of words, the larger the font, the greater the probability of the occurrence of the word. In cryptography, frequency analysis refers to the frequency at which letters or combinations of letters appear in the text. Classical codes can be cracked by using frequency analysis. </p>
	<p>Frequency analysis is based on the principle that different letters or combinations of letters appear at different frequencies in any written language. Moreover, for any piece of text written in this language, there is roughly the same distribution of characteristic letters. For example, in English, the letter E appears very frequently, while the letter X appears less frequently. Similarly, the frequency of two-letter combinations such as ST, NG, TH, and QU is very high, while the combination of NZ and QJ is very few. The 12 letters that appear most frequently in English can be abbreviated as "ETAOIN SHRDLU".</p>
