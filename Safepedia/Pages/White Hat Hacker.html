		<p>	<b>White Hat Hacker</b>ï¼Œare those who use their own hacker technology to maintain the fairness and justice of network relations, testing the performance of networks and systems to determine how strong or weak they can withstand intrusion.</p>
		<h2>How to become a white hat hacker</h2>
		<hr />
		<h3>Technical demand</h3>
		<p>To become a white hat hacker, you must first have a strong technical appeal. There is a skill in the field of cryptography, mathematics, or IT. White Hat hackers are legitimate hackers whose real-life identities are security professionals whose job is to find, test and fix loopholes in crisis computers to make the wild Internet more secure. Among them are social engineering experts, network experts, hardware and software engineers, and there is no doubt that they have a deep understanding of computer technology.</p>
		<p>There are some IT security or white hat hacker certifications in the world, and for those who are in urgent need of hacking experience, passing these certifications may be a shortcut to becoming a white hat hacker. For example, CEH certification, CEH is a neutral organization specializing in evaluating the technical skills of computer professionals, through its evaluation to prove that you have the qualifications to become a good white hat.</p>
		<p>To be talented in this area, you need to have a comprehensive understanding of computer technology, enumeration, social engineering, SQL, Trojans, worms, and other forms of attacks, such as distributed denial attacks (DDoS), Candidates also have to participate in password testing, penetration testing, firewall testing and many other tests.</p>
		<h3>Moral restraint</h3>
		<p>After mastering comprehensive technology, moral requirements and considerations are also necessary for white hat hackers. Because the background of hackers exposed you to a lot of benefits and temptations, sometimes your behavior is on the edge of the law, which requires moral restraint. Make sure that your technology is a malicious attack for the benefit of mankind itself, not for personal gain.</p>
		<p>If you feel that you are not well prepared for your skills or other levels, you can also take part in professional training. Learn how to restore deleted files, crack passwords, investigate and deal with network traffic, and use various forensics tools to collect information. You can also get CHFI credentials, etc., in short, over time, one day you will get what you want.</p>
		<p>Finally, as a binding and self-controlled group of hackers, white hat hackers represent the pioneers of human technology, but also use their own technology to benefit mankind. It is the original intention of white hats to share the knowledge they have learned or mastered on the Internet to help more people solve problems.</p>
		<h2>Five Most Famous White Hat hackers</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Hackers are not all black, those who use their own hacker technology to maintain the fairness and justice of network relations are called "white hat hackers", which is somewhat the same as the nature of network security engineers. Most ordinary hackers are attached to security companies and make a living by testing the security of computer systems.</p>
		<p>1.Stephen Wozniak</p>
		<p>Wozniak, along with Steve Jobs, is the co-founder of apple. His hacking trip also stemmed from stealing toll-free calls. </p>
		<p>He dropped out of school with Jobs to make the first generation of apple PCs, which produced a total of 100 Macintosh computers at $666.66 each. </p>
		<p>At the moment, Wozniak is washing its hands and focusing on philanthropy.</p>
		<p>2.Tim Berners-Lee</p>
		<p>Tim Berners-Lee, the father of the Internet, began attacking with his companions when he was a student at Oxford, and then he was banned from computers by the school. </p>
		<p>He hyperconsciously combined hypertext with TCP and DNS, gave birth to WWW, and then established W3C in MIT.</p>
		<p>3.Linus Torvalds</p>
		<p>Linus Towers is the father of Linux, the best Unix-like system. </p>
		<p>In 1991, based on the Minix operating system, he wrote the Linux kernel and invited programmers to work together to improve the code. Today, only 2% of the code in Linux is written by Linus himself. </p>
		<p>For his outstanding work, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Stockholm University and the University of Helsinki, and time magazine listed him as one of the most influential figures in 60 years.</p>
		<p>4.Richard Stallman</p>
		<p>Stoman launched the GNU project in 1983 to develop a completely free operating system. When he was still working at MIT, they were asked to add passwords to their computers, and he and other hackers thought the password system was a means for system administrators to control users. So he cracked the users' passwords, then emailed them and told them that he had cracked their passwords and told them that it would be shorter and more convenient to use the enter key as his password. To tell them implicitly that safety is just a joke. </p>
		<p>Another experience of requesting the source code of the printer program in order to modify it but was rejected strengthened his belief in following the path of free software. He is currently active in a variety of antitrust activities.</p>
		<p>5.Tsutomu Shimomura</p>
		<p>Shimomura's fame benefited from an attack by the famous black hat hacker, Kevin Mitnick. </p>
		<p>The Japanese-American security expert was miraculously accurate in finding the exact location of the Mitnick. He co-authored a book with the New York Times reporter Markoff (John Markoff): the hunt for America's most wanted computer suspect is described by the hunter.</p>
