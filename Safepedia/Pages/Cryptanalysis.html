		<h1>Cryptanalysis</h1>
		<hr>
		<p><b>Cryptanalysis</b></p>
		<h2>Definition</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Cryptanalysis refers to the study of cryptography, ciphertext or cryptographic system (that is, secret code system), focusing on finding its weakness, without knowing the key and algorithm, to get the original text from the ciphertext. This is also known as cracking passwords, ciphertext, or cryptographic systems. Cracking can sometimes be used with weakening colloids, which usually refer to finding weaknesses in password design or execution to reduce the number of keys in order to brutally crack (simply, Is to try every possible key to find the right one). For example, suppose an balanced password execution uses a key length of 2 ^ 128 bits (to the power of 2 to 128): this means that brute force cracking requires trying 2 ^ 128 possible combinations to be sure that the correct key is found (or, on average, 2 ^ 127 possible combinations). Converting ciphertext to the original seems impossible for both present and future computing power. However, cryptanalysis reveals the encryption of passwords, and it takes only 2 ^ 40 attempts to solve the original text. This is easy for existing computer resources.</p>
		<p>Although the goal of cryptanalysis has been the same in the history of cryptography, the methods and techniques actually used are changing with each passing day as cryptography becomes more and more complex. Cryptography algorithms and protocols developed from ancient times using only pen and paper and other tools to the second World War Ennigma cryptography machine (also known as riddle, German: Enigma), until the current computer-based solutions. And cryptanalysis has changed. In the mid-1970s, public key cryptography developed as a new branch of cryptography. The methods used to crack these public key systems are completely different from those used to live in, and usually need to solve carefully constructed pure mathematical problems. The most famous of these is the prime factorization of large numbers.</p>




		<h2>Classification</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Without knowing any information about the key, a variety of technical means are used to obtain all or part of the information of the plaintext or key through ciphertext. Cryptanalysis is also known as an attack on cryptosystem.</p>
		<p>According to whether the attacker interferes with communication or not, cryptanalysis can be divided into two types: passive attack and active attack. The so-called passive attack means that the attacker only uses the intercepted ciphertext and public algorithm to analyze the plaintext or key and interfere with the communication. The so-called active attack refers to the attacker through the interference of the communication line, such as the introduction of new ciphertext, repeated transmission of the old ciphertext, replacement of legitimate ciphertext, and then analyze the intercepted ciphertext.</p>
		<p>According to the knowledge conditions of the attacker, cryptanalysis can be divided into four types: ciphertext only attack, known plaintext attack, selective plaintext attack and selective ciphertext attack. A ciphertext-only attack means that an attacker knows only one ciphertext to attack (usually containing the context of the message). The so-called known plaintext attack means that the attacker knows some plaintext / ciphertext pairs. If a cryptographic system can resist this attack, the legitimate receiver does not need to destroy the decrypted plaintext. The so-called selective plaintext attack means that the attacker can choose some plaintext and the corresponding ciphertext (the public key cryptosystem must be able to resist this attack). The so-called selective ciphertext attack means that the attacker can select some ciphertext and get the corresponding plaintext.</p>




		<h2>Development</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Cryptanalysis and cryptography are co-evolved. This can be seen from the history of cryptography. New cryptographic machines are always designed to replace designs that have been cracked, and new cryptanalysis methods are always invented to crack improved solutions. In fact, cryptography and cryptanalysis are the pros and cons of the same coin: in order to create a secure password, possible cryptanalysis must be taken into account.</p>
		<p><b>Classical cryptanalysis</b></p>
		<p>Although the word cryptanalysis was coined by William Friedman in 1920, the way to crack passwords and ciphers has been around for a long time. The written record of the earliest password cracking method in the world can be traced back to the ninth century Arab generalist Al Kindi's "cracking password Information" (A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages), which discusses a method of frequency analysis.</p>
		<p>Frequency analysis is a basic method to crack classical passwords. In natural language, some letters in the alphabet appear more frequently than others. For example, in English, the letter E is probably the letter that appears most frequently in any sample of text. Similarly, the combination of the letters TH is the most likely pair of letters. Frequency analysis assumes that passwords do not hide such statistics. For example, in a simple replacement password, where each letter is simply replaced with another letter, the letter that appears most frequently in the ciphertext is most likely to be E.</p>
		<p>Frequency analysis not only needs to use statistics, but also needs to use linguistics. However, with the increasing complexity of cryptographic algorithms, cryptanalysis has gradually become mainly dependent on mathematical methods. This change was most evident during World War II. At that time, in order to crack the password of the Axis Power, more complex mathematical methods needed to be developed. Moreover, automatic computing has been applied to cryptanalysis for the first time, such as the password bomb (Bomba) and one of the earliest computers, the giant computer (Colossus).</p>
		<p><b>Modern cryptanalysis</b></p>
		<p>Although the use of computers during World War II made cryptanalysis easier, it also increased the complexity of the new cryptography scheme by several orders of magnitude. In general, cracking passwords is much more difficult in modern times than it was in the age of paper and pen. It now seems that cryptography has gained the upper hand over pure cryptanalysis. American historian David Kahn said: "Today, many cryptographic systems provided by hundreds of merchants cannot be cracked by known methods of cryptanalysis. Indeed, in such a cryptosystem, even if the attack is attacked with selected plaintext, that is, the attacker can select the plaintext and compare the corresponding ciphertext, he cannot find the key that can be used to unlock other encrypted information. In a sense, cryptanalysis is dead. But the story is not over yet. Cryptanalysis may be dead, but, for example, all roads lead to Rome. " (speech at the 50th Anniversary of the National Security Agency on 1 November 2002). Mr Strauss-Kahn went on to say that other forms of attack were more likely. Examples include intercepting attacks, eavesdropping, side channel attacks, and using quantum computers instead of traditional computers for cryptanalysis.</p>
		<p>Mr Strauss-Kahn's judgment on cryptanalysis may be too early. Unsafe passwords are not extinct, and the methods of cryptanalysis by the National Intelligence Agency have not been made public. In academia, new passwords are constantly being designed and often cracked. In 1984, Madryga block cipher was cracked by a ciphertext-only attack. In 1998, the block cipher FEAL-4, which was originally proposed to replace the DES standard encryption algorithm, also died out because of a lot of similar and feasible attacks discovered by the academic circles. In industry, many passwords have also been found to have vulnerabilities. For example, the A5, A5, and CMEA algorithms used in mobile phones can be cracked in hours, minutes, or even in real time with general computing tools. In 2001, the Wired equivalent encryption Protocol (or Wireless encryption Protocol, or WEP), which is used to protect wireless Wi-Fi networks, can also be cracked with related key attacks.</p>
		<p><b>Consequences of cryptanalysis</b></p>
		<p>There is no doubt that successful cryptanalysis has affected the course of history. The ability to understand what others think is a secret idea or plan can be a decisive advantage. This is especially true during the war. For example, in World War I, the successful deciphering of the Zimmerman Telegraph was the direct cause of the United States' participation in the war. In World War II, the successful cracking of German passwords, including the Enigma and Lorentz ciphers, ranged from bringing the European battlefield to an end a few months earlier to playing a decisive role in the war as a whole. There are various statements (see ULTRA). The United States also benefits from cryptanalysis of PURPLE passwords in Japan (see MAGIC).</p>
		<p>Some governments have long recognized the importance of cryptanalysis for intelligence gathering, both militarily and diplomatically. These countries have also set up institutions that specialize in password cracking, such as (GCHQ), the UK government communications headquarters, and (NSA), the US national security agency. These institutions are very active today. In 2004, it was reported that the United States had successfully cracked the Iranian code. But it is not clear whether this is pure cryptanalysis or whether there are other factors.</p>




		<h2>Analytical types of cryptanalysis</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>1„ÄÅBrute force attack</p>
		<p>Brute force attacks include table lookup attacks, time-storage tradeoff attacks, dictionary attacks, and exhaustive search attacks. For any kind of block cipher, brute force attack is applicable. In particular, the complexity of this attack method depends only on the length of the key and packet. More strictly speaking, the time complexity of this attack technique only depends on the efficiency of the block cipher algorithm, such as storage size, key expansion speed, encryption and decryption speed and so on.</p>
		<p>2„ÄÅLinear cryptanalysis</p>
		<p>As a known plaintext attack method, the essential idea of linear cryptanalysis method is to decipher it by expressing a given cryptographic algorithm effectively and linearly. The existing cryptographic analysis technology has also been popularized to some extent. At present, using known plaintext, 16-round DES systems can be deciphered by linear cryptanalysis, and in some cases can even implement ciphertext-only attacks. The main attacks against the data encryption standard DES system include brute force attack, differential cryptanalysis and so on. As far as the 16-round DES cryptosystem is concerned, whether it is differential cryptanalysis or linear cryptanalysis, too much plaintext is needed, so the efficiency is low. In order to improve the attack efficiency, differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis can be combined.</p>
		<p>3„ÄÅDifferential cryptanalysis</p>
		<p>In 1990, Israeli cryptographers Biham and Shamir proposed differential cryptanalysis. Differential cryptanalysis is particularly suitable for iterative cryptography. The essential idea of differential cryptanalysis is to obtain some bit information of the key by analyzing the relationship between the difference of the corresponding plaintext and the difference of the ciphertext. There are also a lot of generalizations for differential cryptanalysis, among which the more common ones include high-order differential cryptanalysis and so on.</p>
