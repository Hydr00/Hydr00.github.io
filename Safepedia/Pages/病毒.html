		<h1>Computer Virus</h1>
		<hr />
		<p>is a set of computer instructions or program code that can be inserted into a computer program to destroy computer functions or data, can affect the use of the computer, and can copy itself.</p>
		<p>Computer viruses have the characteristics of transmission, concealment, infectivity, latent, excitable, expressive or destructive. The life cycle of computer virus: the development period→the infection period→the incubation period→the outbreak period→the discovery period→the digestion period→the extinction period.</p>
		
		<h2>Brief introduction</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Computer viruses are man-made, destructive, contagious and latent programs that destroy computer information or systems. It does not exist independently, but is hidden in other executable programs. After the virus in the computer, the light will affect the running speed of the machine, and the heavy will destroy the machine system; therefore, the virus brings great losses to the user. Usually, we call this destructive program a computer virus.</p>
		<p>According to the existing media classification, computer viruses can be divided into three types: guided virus, file virus and mixed virus, and can be divided into three types: source code virus, embedded virus and operating system virus. According to the system classification of computer virus attack, it can be divided into attacking DOS system virus, attacking Windows, system virus and attacking UNIX system virus. Today's computer viruses are constantly innovating, including some unique new viruses that are temporarily unable to classify according to conventional types, such as Internet viruses (spread over the network). Some carry more and more data about viruses), e-mail viruses, and so on.</p>
		<p>Computer virus is recognized as the number one enemy of data security. Computer virus has been paid more and more attention all over the world since 1987, and computer virus was first discovered in China in 1989. At present, the new virus is developing in the direction of more destructive, more hidden, higher infection rate, faster transmission speed and so on. Therefore, we must deeply study the basic common sense of computer viruses and strengthen the prevention of computer viruses.</p>
		
		<h2>Types</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>In order to understand and prevent computer viruses more clearly, we classify them according to the type of media they depend on.：</p>
		<p>1）Network virus: a computer virus that infects an executable through a computer network</p>
		<p>2）File virus: a virus that specializes in files in a computer</p>
		<p>3）Boot virus: a virus that infects the drive sector and the boot sector of the hard disk system</p>
		<p>In addition, computer viruses can be classified based on specific computer algorithms. The main types of viruses are：</p>
		<p>1）Incidental virus: it is usually attached to a EXE file with the same name as the EXE file name, but the extension is different and generally does not destroy the change file itself, but it is this type of virus that is first activated when DOS reads.</p>
		<p>2）Worm: it does not damage computer files and data, and its destructiveness depends largely on the deployment of the computer network. You can use a computer network to switch from one computer store to another to calculate a network address to infect a virus.</p>
		<p>3）Mutable viruses: complex algorithms can be applied on their own and are difficult to detect because the content and length are different in another place.</p>
		
		<h2>Transmission route</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Computer viruses have their own transmission modes and different transmission paths. The main function of the computer itself is its own replication and transmission, which means that the spread of computer viruses is very easy, usually in an environment where data can be exchanged. There are three main types of computer virus transmission：</p>
		<p>1）Virus transmission through removable storage devices, such as U disk, CD, floppy disk, mobile hard disk, etc., can be the path to spread the virus, and because they are often moved and used, they are more likely to be favored by computer viruses. Become a carrier of computer viruses；</p>
		<p>2）Spread through the network: the network methods described here are also different. Web pages, e-mail, QQ, BBS, etc., can all be the ways of computer virus network transmission, especially in recent years, with the development of network technology and the running frequency of the Internet, The speed of computer viruses is getting faster and faster, and the scope of computer viruses is gradually expanding.；</p>
		<p>3）Using the weaknesses of computer systems and application software to spread: in recent years, more and more computer viruses take advantage of the shortcomings of application systems and software applications to spread out, so this way is also divided into the basic mode of computer virus transmission.</p>
		
		<h2>Characteristics</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>As long as any virus invades the system, it will have varying degrees of impact on the system and applications. Light will reduce computer efficiency, occupy system resources, heavy can lead to data loss, system crash. The programmability of a computer virus, like other legitimate programs, is an executable program, but it is not a complete program, but a program parasitic on other executable programs, only when other programs are running. It's the virus that destroys it. Once the virus enters the computer and is executed, it will search for other eligible environments, determine the target and then make itself into it, so as to achieve the purpose of self-reproduction. Therefore, infectivity is an important condition for judging computer viruses.</p>
		<p>Only when the virus meets its specific conditions, it will cause fatal damage to the computer. The computer or system will not react immediately after poisoning, and the virus will be hidden in the system for a long time. For example, the most unforgettable attack is the 26th attack of CIH, in addition to the famous "Black Friday" on the 13th Friday, and so on. Viruses are usually attached to normal hard drives or programs, and it is difficult for computer users to find them before it is activated. They use high programming skills to program, and they are a kind of short executable program. Has a devastating effect on computers; Generally, no user takes the initiative to execute the virus program, but the virus will work when its conditions are ripe, or destroy the program, disrupt the work of the system, and so on. The unauthorized operation of a computer is a typical feature of a computer virus, which runs automatically without the permission of the operator.</p>
		
		<h3>Concealment</h3>
		<p>Computer virus is not easy to be found, this is because the computer virus has a strong concealment, it often exists in the way of hidden files or program code, in the ordinary virus detection and killing, it is difficult to achieve timely and effective detection and killing. The virus is disguised as a normal program and is difficult to detect by computer virus scanning. In addition, some viruses are designed as virus repair programs to induce users to use, and then achieve virus implantation, intrusion into the computer. Therefore, the concealment of computer virus makes computer security prevention in a passive state, resulting in serious security risks.</p>
		<h3>Destructive</h3>
		<p>The virus invades the computer, often has the extremely destructive, can destroy the data information, even causes the large area computer paralysis, causes the big loss to the computer user. Such as common Trojan horses, worms and other computer viruses, can invade the computer on a large scale, bringing security risks to the computer.</p>
		<h3>Parasitism</h3>
		<p>Computer viruses also have parasitic characteristics. Computer virus needs to be parasitized in the host in order to survive, in order to give full play to its function and destroy the normal function of the host. Usually, computer viruses are parasitized in other normal programs or data, and on this basis, they can be transmitted by a certain medium. Once a certain setting condition is reached in the actual operation of the host computer, The computer virus will be activated, with the start of the program, the computer virus will continue to assist and modify the host computer files, so that its destructive role can be brought into play.</p>
		<h3>Enforceability</h3>
		<p>Like other legitimate programs, a computer virus is an executable program, but it is not a complete program, but parasitic on other executable programs, so it has all the rights available to the program.</p>
		<h3>Triggering</h3>
		<p>The characteristic of a virus that induces infection or attack as a result of an event or value.</p>
		<h3>Initiative of attack</h3>
		<p>The attack of the virus to the system is active, no matter how strict the protective measures taken by the computer system, it is impossible to completely eliminate the attack of the virus to the system, and the protective measures are at best a means of prevention.</p>
		<h3>The pertinence of the virus</h3>
		<p>Computer viruses are specific to specific computers and specific operating systems. For example, there are IBM PCs and their compatible computers, Macintosh for Apple companies, and UNIX operating systems. For example, the glomerular virus is targeted at the DOS operating system on IBM PCs and their compatible computers.</p>
		
		<h2>The main symptoms of poisoned computers</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>The main symptoms of poisoned computers are many, and any abnormal computer may be related to the virus. After the computer is infected with the virus, if it does not attack, it is very difficult to detect. But when the virus attacks, it is easy to feel from the following symptoms: it will be very abnormal; inexplicably crash; suddenly restart or unable to start; the program can not run; disk bad clusters inexplicably increase; disk space becomes smaller; The system starts slowly; the data and programs are lost; abnormal sound, music or meaningless picture greetings appear; Normal peripheral use anomalies, such as printing problems, keyboard input characters and screen display inconsistent; exceptions require the user to enter a password.</p>
		
		<h2>Examples of common viruses</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>The "love bug" virus. The virus is spread through the Microsoft outlook email system, with the subject "I LOVE YOU" and containing an attachment. Once the message is opened in Microsoft outlook, the system automatically replicates and sends the virus to all mail addresses in the address book. The "love bug" virus is a worm that can rewrite certain files on local and network hard drives. After exposure, the mail system slows down and may cause the entire network system to crash.</p>
		<p>CIH virus. CIH is a pure windows 9598 virus that is widely transmitted through mutual copying of software, the use of pirated optical discs and the spread of Internet networks. When the CIH virus breaks out, it will cover 1024K bytes in front of the hard disk with messy data, destroy the motherboard BIOS chip, make the machine unable to start, and completely destroy the computer system.</p>
		<p>Happy 99 borer. It is an automatic transmission of the virus through the Email, if you click on it, there will be a colorful image, many people think of it as software such as New year cards. It installs itself under Windows and modifies the registry and loads automatically the next time it starts. After the virus is successfully installed, all emails sent will have an attachment, Happy 99.exe, which the recipient clicks on and the computer will be poisoned.</p>
		<p>Trojan horse virus, hacker virus. Trojan virus prefix is: Trojan, hacker virus prefix name is generally Hack. The public characteristic of Trojan virus is to enter the user's system and hide it through the network or system loophole, and then divulge the user's information to the outside world, while the hacker virus has a visual interface, which can control the user's computer remotely. Trojan horse, hacker virus often appears in pairs, that is, the Trojan horse virus is responsible for invading the user's computer, and the hacker virus will be controlled by the Trojan horse virus. Now both types are becoming more and more integrated.</p>
		<p>Script virus. The prefix for the script virus is: Script. The common feature of scripting viruses is a virus that spreads through a web page written in a scripting language. Script viruses also have the following prefixes: VBS, JS (indicating what kind of script was written), such as happy hour (VBS.Happytime), 14th (Js.Fortnight.c.s), and so on.</p>
		<p>Macro virus. In fact, macro virus is also a kind of script virus, because of its particularity, so it is classified as a separate category here. The prefix for macro viruses is: Macro, the second prefix is: Word, Word97, Excel, Excel 97 (and perhaps others). All viruses that are only infected with WORD97 and previous versions of WORD documents use Word97 as the second prefix. The format is: Macro.Word97;. All viruses that only infect WORD documents after WORD97 use Word as the second prefix. The format is: Macro.Word;. All viruses that are only infected with EXCEL97 and previous versions of EXCEL documents use Excel97 as the second prefix, and the format is: Macro.Excel97; uses Excel as the second prefix for viruses that only infect EXCEL documents after EXCEL97, the format is: Macro.Excel, and so on. The public characteristic of this kind of virus is that it can infect OFFICE series documents and then spread through OFFICE common template.</p>
		<p>Backdoor virus. The prefix of the backdoor virus is: Backdoor. The public characteristic of this kind of virus is that it spreads through the network, opens the back door to the system, and brings the hidden danger to the user's computer. Such as 54 many friends have encountered the IRC back door Backdoor.IRCBot.</p>
		
		<h2>Harm</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>It is very important to raise awareness of the prevention of computer viruses and to recognize that viruses are destructive and destructive. Nowadays, computers have been used in various industries, computers and computer networks have become an important part of people's lives, and viruses will destroy and tamper with computer data, and theft will cause serious network security problems. Affect the efficiency of the use of the network.</p>
		<p>（1）If the virus is excited, the computer will react greatly; Most viruses directly destroy the important information data of the computer when excited, it will directly destroy the CMOS settings or delete important files, will format the disk or rewrite the directory area, will use "junk" data to overwrite the file. A computer virus is a piece of computer code that must occupy computer memory space. Some large viruses still replicate themselves within the computer, resulting in a significant reduction in computer memory. When the virus runs, it also preempts the interrupt and modifies the interrupt address to add the "private goods" of the virus in the process of interrupt, which interferes with the normal operation of the system. After the virus invades the system, it will automatically collect the important data of the user, steal and leak the information and data, resulting in a large number of leakage of user information, and bring inestimable losses and serious consequences to the user.</p>
		<p>（2）Consumes memory and disk space. For example, you don't have access to the disk, but the disk lights are flashing, or when you don't actually run many programs, you find that the system is already taking up a lot of memory, which could be a virus. Many viruses are resident in memory in the active state, some file-type viruses can infect a large number of files in a short time, each file is lengthened to varying degrees, resulting in a serious waste of disk space. Normal software often needs to be perfected by multiple tests, and computer viruses are usually sent out quickly by individuals after they are completed on a computer. So the harm that the virus brings to the computer is not only the virus that the maker expects, but also some caused by the error of the computer virus.</p>
		<p>（3）Computer viruses cause serious psychological stress to users the proliferation of viruses makes users nervous and worried about being infected by the virus at all times, because most people do not know much about the virus. Once there are phenomena such as computer crash, abnormal operation of software and so on, people often suspect that these phenomena may be caused by computer viruses. According to statistics, computer users suspect that "computers have viruses" is a common phenomenon, more than 70% of computer users worry that their computers have invaded the virus, but in fact, all kinds of phenomena that occur in computers are not all caused by viruses.</p>

		<h2>Precautionary measures</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Computer viruses are watching the computer all the time, always ready to attack, but the computer virus is not uncontrollable, through the following aspects to reduce the damage caused by computer viruses to the computer：</p>
		<p>（1）Install the latest antivirus software, upgrade the antivirus software virus library every day, regularly check and kill the virus on the computer, and turn on all monitoring of the antivirus software when surfing the Internet. Cultivate good Internet habits, such as: carefully open unknown emails and attachments, websites that may contain viruses are as different as possible, use more complex passwords as much as possible, and guessing simple passwords is a new way for many network viruses to attack systems.</p>
		<p>（2）Do not execute software downloaded from the network without antivirus treatment, etc. Do not casually visit or log on to strange websites, strengthen self-protection now there are many illegal websites, and be infiltrated into malicious code, once opened by the user, will be implanted Trojans or other viruses.</p>
		<p>（3）Cultivate a conscious awareness of information security, and when using mobile storage devices, do not share these devices as far as possible, because mobile storage is also the main way for computers to spread and the main target of computer virus attacks. In places where the requirements for information security are relatively high, the USB interface on the computer should be closed, at the same time, under certain conditions, it should be dedicated to the special machine.</p>
		<p>（4）Patch the whole system with the Windows Update function, and upgrade the application software to the latest version, such as player software, communication tools, etc. Avoid viruses from web Trojans to the system or through other application software vulnerabilities to spread the virus; Isolate the computer infringed by the virus as soon as possible, in the process of using the computer, if there is a virus or computer anomaly on the computer, the network should be interrupted in time. When it is found that the computer network has been interrupted or the network is abnormal, interrupt the network immediately to prevent the virus from spreading in the network.</p>
