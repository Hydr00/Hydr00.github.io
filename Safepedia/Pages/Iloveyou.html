		<h1>I Love You</h1>
		<hr />
		<p>The worm virus, also known as the "I love you" virus, is a worm that is very similar to the Melissa virus of 1999. The virus is said to be able to rewrite certain files on local and network hard drives. After the user machine is poisoned, the mail system will slow down and may cause the entire network system to crash.</p>
		<p>On May 4, 2000, a computer virus called "I Love you" began to spread rapidly around the world. The virus is spread through the Microsoft Outlook email system with the subject "I LOVE YOU" and contains an attachment. Once the message is opened in Microsoft Outlook, the system automatically replicates and sends the virus to all mail addresses in the address book.</p>
		
		<h2>Background information</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Because it was spread through the e-mail system, the "I love you" virus attacked countless computers around the world in a very short period of time, and, judging from the infected computer systems, The target of the "love bug" virus is not an ordinary computer user. It is computer systems with high-value IT resources: the e-mail systems of several security services of the US Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the British Parliament and a number of multinational companies have been attacked.</p>
		<p>It is said that the "love bug" virus is the fastest and most widely spread computer virus found so far. It has had a negative impact on a number of institutions around the world, including stockbrokers, food, media, automotive and technology companies, as well as universities and even hospitals.</p>
		
		<h2>Variety</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Shortly after the crazy "love bug" virus was discovered, the global virus monitoring network found that in order to seduce more Internet users, the virus has now generated another variant of the virus. E-mail headings with the virus often carry the word "joke" to entice users to open the message. It is expected that the "I love you" virus will produce more types of variant viruses in the next few days.</p>
		<p>The new variant, discovered by Guanqun Jinchen, includes a folder called "particularly ridiculous" in addition to the word "joke" in the subject line of the email. To this end, Guanqun Jin Chen specially reminded the majority of network users not to open any emails with the above logo and should delete them immediately. At the same time, Guanqun Jinchen reminded computer users to upgrade KILL anti-virus software in time, because the latest version of KILL virus library can be found and killed this virus.</p>
		
		<h2>Prevention</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>The beauty of the worm virus is that it can automatically send the virus to all emails in the infected address book through Microsoft Outlook, causing the network system to crash. The virus has a similar means of transmission to the panicked beautiful killer, the Melissa, Melissa virus, which was feared last year. By contrast, the virus is more infectious, looking for local and mapped drives, and searching all directories and subdirectories of the system for targets that can be infected. This is also an important reason why the virus can once again cause widespread network paralysis around the world a year after the outbreak of the Beautiful Killer.</p>
		<p>Guanqun Jinchen believes that the development of the network in the 21st century has given birth to unlimited business opportunities for enterprises and individuals. However, with the advent of the network, hackers have wantonly attacked websites and worms have led to serious network paralysis. Has been sounding the alarm of network security to people. According to the statistics of the current means of virus transmission, the current network insecurity factors faced by enterprises mainly come from the mail system. The viruses that pose the greatest and most threats to individual users are also spread through mail and the Internet. With "beautiful killer", "ZIP worm", "love worm" and so on a large number of viruses automatically through the Internet mail system showed the trend of accelerated outbreak frequency. Therefore, as an anti-drug manufacturer, what we need to do now is to protect every computer and server that may spread the virus within the enterprise. In particular, it is worth pointing out that. The security protection of mail system has become a security problem that enterprises must solve at present. And enterprise-class network security products must have excellent advanced real-time protection technology, full-platform protection technology, At the same time, security products should provide rapid virus capture and virus library upgrade functions for frequent unsafe factors such as viruses and worms, that is, they have the ability of global virus surveillance and national service network.</p>
		<p>In view of the current situation in which enterprises are threatened by the outbreak of mail viruses, Jinchen has launched a series of packages specifically aimed at enterprise users. Guanqun Jinchen seamlessly integrates KILL for Microsoft Exchange and KILL for Lotus Notes, the only email groupware protection software evaluated by the Ministry of Public Security, with KILL network version of server-side products and client-side products. To provide users with advanced virus detection technology, through the three-in-one comprehensive protection of servers, mail servers and clients, so as to achieve the functions of automatic discovery, automatic alarm, and automatic removal of all viruses transmitted through the network. Protect users' mail and file systems at all times to ensure that users will not be plagued by viruses such as "love bugs". The network of enterprises will be able to really build secure buildings.</p>
