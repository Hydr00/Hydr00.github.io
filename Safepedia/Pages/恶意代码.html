		<h1>Malicious Code</h1>
		<hr />
		<p>Malicious Code refers to code that is ineffective but dangerous. One of the safest definitions is to treat all unnecessary code as malicious, and unnecessary code has a broader meaning than malicious code. Includes all software that may conflict with an organization's security policy.</p>
		
		<h2>Definition</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Definition 1: malicious code is also known as malware. These software can also be called adware, spyware, malicious shareware. Refers to the software that infringes upon the legitimate rights and interests of the user by installing and running on the user's computer or other terminal without explicitly prompting the user or without the permission of the user. Unlike viruses or worms, many of these software are not written and distributed in secret by small groups or individuals, but are suspected by many well-known companies and groups. Sometimes called rogue software.</p>
		<p>Definition 2: malicious code is computer code that is deliberately programmed or set up and poses a threat or potential threat to the network or system. The most common malicious code is computer virus (hereinafter referred to as virus), Trojan Horse (referred to as Trojan Horse), computer worm (referred to as worm), backdoor, logic bomb and so on.</p>
		
		<h2>Characteristics</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Have the following common characteristics：</p>
		<p>（1） A malicious purpose</p>
		<p>（2） It's a computer program.</p>
		<p>（3） Work through execution</p>
		<p>Some prank programs or game programs cannot be considered malicious code. There are many literatures about the characteristics of filter viruses, although there are a large number of them, but the mechanism is similar, within the scope of protection of antivirus programs, it is more noteworthy that non-filter viruses.</p>
		
		<h2>Non-filtered virus</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Non-filtered viruses include password cracking software, sniffer software, keyboard input recording software, remote Troy and espionage, and so on. Attackers inside or outside the organization use this software to obtain passwords, detect network communications, record private communications, and secretly receive and transmit unauthorized commands from remote hosts. Some privately installed P2P software is actually tantamount to making a hole in an enterprise firewall. Non-filtering viruses are on the rise, and defense against them is not a simple task. Concepts related to non-viral viruses include：</p>
		<h3>Remote access to Troy</h3>
		<p>Remote access to Troy RAT is a program installed on the victim's machine to implement unauthorized network access, such as NetBus and SubSeven, which can be disguised as other programs, confusing users to install, such as emails that can be executed. Or Web download files, or games and greeting cards, etc., can also be physically close to the way to install directly.</p>
		<h3>Zombies</h3>
		<p>Malicious code is not all controlled internally. In distributed denial of service attacks, many Internet sites are attacked by zombies programs on other hosts. Zombies programs can take advantage of the security vulnerabilities of computer systems on the network to install automatic attack scripts on multiple hosts, which become victims and follow the command of the attacker, and at some point, come together to attack other victims.</p>
		<h3>Illegal access</h3>
		<p>Password cracking, network sniffing and network vulnerability scanning are the main means for internal personnel to spy on colleagues and obtain illegal access to resources. These attack tools are not executed automatically, but are covertly manipulated.</p>
		<h3>Keyboard recording program</h3>
		<p>Some user organizations use PC activity monitoring software to monitor the operation of users, to prevent employees from improperly using resources through keyboard logging, or to collect evidence of criminals. The software can also be used by attackers for information spying and cyber attacks.</p>
		<h3>P2P System</h3>
		<p>Internet-based point-to-point (peer-to-peer) applications such as Napster, Gotomypc, AIM, and Groove, as well as remote access tool channels such as Gotomypc, can penetrate firewalls through HTTP or other public ports. Allowing employees to set up their own VPN, is sometimes dangerous for an organization or a company. Because these programs first connect remotely from the internal PC to the outer Gotomypc host, and then the user can access the PC of the office through this connection. If this kind of connection is used, it will bring great harm to the organization or enterprise.</p>

		<p>Logic bombs and time bombs are programs designed to destroy data and applications. Typically implanted by disgruntled employees within the organization, logic bombs and time bombs damage networks and systems to a large extent, and Timothy Lloyd, a former network administrator at Omega Engineering, In 1996, a software logic bomb buried in the former employer's computer system caused $10 million in damage, and he was recently sentenced to 41 months in prison.</p>
		
		<h2>Communication method</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Malicious code writers generally use three types of means to spread malicious code: software vulnerabilities, users themselves, or a mixture of the two. Some malicious code is self-initiated worms and embedded scripts that are software in itself, and such malicious code does not require human activity. Some malicious code, such as Trojan horses and e-mail worms, use the psychology of victims to manipulate them to execute unsafe code; others trick users into turning off protection measures to install malicious code.</p>
		<p>Malicious code that exploits commercial software defects is Code Red, KaK, and BubbleBoy. They rely entirely on defects and weaknesses in commercial software products, such as overflow vulnerabilities and the ability to execute arbitrary code in inappropriate environments. Unpatched IIS software, for example, has a flaw in input buffer overflows. The attack code that exploits Web service defects are worms on Code Red, Nimda,Linux, and Solaris that also take advantage of remote computer flaws.</p>
		<p>A typical technique of malicious code writers is to disguise malicious code mail as infection alarm messages from other malicious code victims, who are often users in the Outlook address book or WEB pages in the buffer. Doing so is most likely to attract the attention of the victims. Some authors of malicious code have also shown a high degree of psychological manipulation, and LoveLetter is a prominent example. The average user is increasingly wary of email attachments from strangers, and the authors of malicious code have designed baits to attract the interest of victims. The use of attachments is and will be restricted and blocked by the gateway filter, and the author of malicious code will also try to bypass the inspection of the gateway filter. The techniques used may include using vague file types, compressing public execution file types into zip files, and so on.</p>
		<p>The number of attacks on chat room IRC (Internet Relay Chat) and instant messaging IM (instant messaging) systems is increasing, mostly by deceiving users to download and execute automatic Agent software, so that remote systems can be used as attack platforms for distributed denial of service (DDoS). Or use backdoor programs and Trojan horse programs to control it.</p>
		
		<h2>Spread trend</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>The spread of malicious code has the following trends</p>
		
		<h3>The category is more vague.</h3>
		<p>The spread of malicious code does not depend solely on software vulnerabilities or one of the social engineering, but may be a mixture of them. Worms, for example, produce parasitic file viruses, Trojan programs, password theft programs, and backdoor programs, further blurring the difference between worms, viruses, and Trojans.</p>
		<h3>Mixed propagation mode</h3>
		<p>"Mixed virus threat" and "converge (convergent) threat" have become new virus terms. "Red Code" takes advantage of IIS vulnerabilities. Nimda is actually a derivative of the Morris worm that emerged in 1988, and they are all characterized by exploiting vulnerabilities. It does not take long for the virus model to evolve from a boot zone mode to a multi-type virus worm mode.</p>
		<h3>Multiple platforms</h3>
		<p>Multi-platform attacks are beginning to emerge, and some malicious code can work on incompatible platforms. Worms from Windows can exploit Apache vulnerabilities, while Linux worms derive Trojans in exe format.</p>
		<h3>Use sales technology</h3>
		<p>Another trend is for more malicious code to use sales technology, which is not only aimed at using the victim's mailbox to achieve maximum forwarding, but more importantly, to arouse the interest of the victim and allow the victim to further manipulate the malicious file. And use network detection, email script embedding and other technologies that do not use attachments to achieve their goals.</p>
		<p>The maker of malware (malware) may combine some well-known attacks with new vulnerabilities to create the next generation of WM/Concept, the next generation of Code Red, the next generation of Nimda. For antivirus software makers, it takes a lot of time to change their ways to deal with new threats.</p>
		<h3>Server and client</h3>
		<p>For malicious code, the difference between the server and the client is becoming more and more blurred, and the client computer and the server will also be attacked by malicious code if they run the same application. For example, IIS service is an operating system default service, so the drawback of its service program is that the impact of, Code Red, which is common to all machines, is not limited to servers, but also affects a large number of personal computers.</p>
		<h3>Windows Operation System</h3>
		<p>Windows operating system is more vulnerable to malicious code attacks, it is also the most concentrated platform for virus attacks, viruses always choose poorly configured network shares and services as entry points. Other overflow issues, including string format and heap overflow, remain the basis for filtering virus intrusions. The attack points and ancillary functions of viruses and worms are selected by the author. Another flaw is that it allows arbitrary or inappropriate code execution. As scriptlet.typelib and Eyedog vulnerabilities spread in chat rooms, JS/Kak exploits IE/Outlook vulnerabilities, resulting in two ActiveX controls executing at the trust level. But they still execute illegal code without the user knowing it. Some recent vulnerability posts have reported that Windows Media Player can be used to bypass the security settings of Outlook 2002 to execute JavaScript and ActiveX code embedded in HTML mail. This kind of news will certainly arouse the hacker's attack enthusiasm. The general filtering method of exploiting vulnerability bypass is one of the typical techniques used by malicious code.</p>
		<h3>Malicious code type change</h3>
		<p>In addition, another type of malicious code is to exploit the weak handling of the uuencode header to disguise malicious code as a secure data type to trick client software into executing inappropriate code.</p>
		
		<h2>Related issues</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>（1）There is no standard way to protect against viruses, and experts believe that the safer way is to update the virus library once a week, but in special cases, it needs to be updated more frequently. In 1999, the Y2K virus database needed to be updated daily, while in May 2000, in order to deal with variants of the LoveLetter virus, the virus library had to be updated several times a day. It should be noted that sometimes this frequent update has little to do with the improvement of protection.</p>
		<p>（2）Users complain a lot about Microsoft's operating system and applications, but the functionality of the virus protection tool itself is one of the most complaining factors.</p>
		<p>（3）Heuristic virus search is not widely used because cleaning up a virus is less expensive than adjusting heuristic software and is likened to "treatment is worse than the disease itself."</p>
		<p>（4）Enterprises have spent a lot of energy on firewall management and e-mail management, and it is recommended to use separate people and tools to accomplish this task.</p>
		<p>（5）Malicious code attack data analysis is not enough, although some virus scanning software has a system activity log, but due to file size constraints, can not be saved for a long time. At the same time, the measurement and analysis of the degree of malicious code infection is not enough, the general enterprise can not clearly describe the security problems of their own company from the tactical and strategic levels.</p>
		<p>（6）The virus scanning software simply notifies the user to change the settings, not automatically modify the settings.</p>
		<p>（7）Virus protection software itself has security flaws, easy to be exploited by attackers, only because of fear of being attacked, virus software manufacturers do not want to talk about.</p>
		<p>（8）A lot of software can be used for both security management and security breakthroughs. The problem is intent, such as vulnerability scanners and sniffers, that can be used by attackers.</p>
	
		<h2>Influence</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>The transmission mode of malicious code is rapidly evolving, from the boot area to a certain type of file transmission, to macro virus transmission, to mail transmission, to network transmission, attack and epidemic time is getting shorter and shorter. The Form boot zone virus appeared in 1989 and took a year to become popular. The macro virus Concept Macro appeared in 1995 and took three months to popularize. It took about a day for LoveLetter, about 90 minutes for Code Red and less than 30 minutes for Nimda. The pattern behind these numbers is clear: at every step of the evolution of malicious code, viruses and worms take less and less time from release to popularity.</p>
		<p>Malicious code itself is increasingly directly exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems or applications, rather than relying solely on social engineering. Servers and network facilities are increasingly being targeted. Worm programs such as L10n, PoisonBOx, Code Red and Nimda, which exploit vulnerabilities for self-propagation and no longer need to ride other code.</p>
