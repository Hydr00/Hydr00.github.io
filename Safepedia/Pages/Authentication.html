		<h1>Authentication</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>Authentication</p>
		<h2>Identity authentication</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Definition</h3>
		<p>	Also known as identity "authentication" refers to through certain means to complete the confirmation of the identity of the user. There are many methods of authentication, which can be divided into: authentication based on shared key, authentication based on biological characteristics and authentication based on public key encryption algorithm.</p>
		<p> The purpose of authentication is to confirm that the user currently claimed to be an identity is indeed the claimed user. Authentication is not uncommon in daily life; for example, by checking the other person's identity, we can generally be sure of the other person's identity. Although this practice of identifying the other party in daily life also belongs to the broad sense of "authentication", the term "authentication" is more commonly used in the fields of computers, communications, and so on.</p>
		<h3>Method</h3>
		<p>There are many methods of authentication, which can be divided into: authentication based on shared key, authentication based on biological characteristics and authentication based on public key encryption algorithm. Different authentication methods, security also has its own high and low.</p>
		<p>1.Based on shared key</p>
		<p>Shared key-based authentication refers to the sharing of one or a set of passwords between the server and the user. When a user needs to authenticate, the user submits a password jointly owned by the user and the server by entering or through a device that holds the password. After receiving the password submitted by the user, the server checks whether the password submitted by the user is consistent with the password saved on the server side, and if so, determines that the user is a legitimate user. If the password submitted by the user does not match the password saved on the server side, authentication fails.</p>
		<p>There are many services that use shared key-based authentication, such as the vast majority of network access services, the vast majority of BBS, Wikipedia and so on.</p>
		<p>2.Based on biological characteristics</p>
		<p>Authentication based on biological characteristics refers to the unique characteristics of each person, such as fingerprint, iris and so on.</p>
		<p>For example, Synaptics Natural ID fingerprint sensor solution, AES256 bit encryption of fingerprint template data, plays a key role in the rapid deployment of biometric authentication technology on smartphones.</p>
		<p>3.Encryption algorithm based on Public key</p>
		<p>Authentication based on public key encryption algorithm means that both parties in communication hold public key and private key respectively, and one of them uses private key to encrypt specific data, while the other uses public key to decrypt the data. If decryption is successful, the user is considered a legitimate user, otherwise authentication fails.</p>
		<p>Services that use authentication based on public key encryption algorithms are SSL, digital signatures, and so on.</p>
		<h3>Scanning mode</h3>
		<p>1.Know in advance the system in which authentication is scanned</p>
		<p>This may include all Windows and Linux-based systems, or a small number of computer parts, such as servers or workgroups. In addition, it is important to consider scanning Web applications, databases, and all network hosts that allow or require authentication through protocols such as Telnet, FTP, SSH, and SNMP. Many commercial vulnerability scanners, such as Nexpose and LanGuard, provide a variety of ways to scan. If hackers outside your network or malicious users inside your network start using authentication scans, you need to do the same.</p>
		<p>2.Determine what user role level you want to scan</p>
		<p>The author recommends at least using administrator or root login credentials for scanning; you will find most of the vulnerabilities. However, by scanning different user roles (such as manager-level roles or basic user roles), you can better understand the resources that each user group can see and utilize. To some extent, the more user roles you test, the better the results will be (although in some cases there will be a pattern of diminishing results). When you see that your results no longer change according to permissions, you will know when to stop.</p>
		<p>3.Set up a user account for authentication scanning</p>
		<p>This does not require a password change on the first login (this is a common setting for Active Directory Group Policy and some web applications). If you forget this, your scanner will prompt you to change your password when you log in for the first time, which of course can't be done. You may not know this, and then continue with the scan. After a few minutes (perhaps longer), you will realize that authentication is not available and you will need to start scanning again. With the web vulnerability scanner, you may need to create a login macro to allow you to test. For some reason, most network vulnerability scanners do not offer the option to test your login credentials before you start scanning. The only two scanners I know that have this functionality are the old Harris STAT scanner and the Rapid7 Nexpose. This may seem like a clich Ã©, but in the long run, this feature can save you a lot of time and trouble.</p>
		<p>4.First ensure that authentication vulnerabilities are scanned for network hosts</p>
		<p>That is to say, this can cause problems in the production environment, especially when scanning web applications. No matter what you are scanning, it will consume CPU, disk and network cycles, log files and databases may be filled, user accounts may be locked, and so on. The author recommends that you first run authentication scans on one or two systems to see what side effects will occur, and then expand to scan thousands of systems.</p>
		<p>5.Generate spreadsheet reports by vulnerability sorting</p>
		<p>Many security vulnerabilities can be found during authentication scans, especially when looking at the results in traditional PDF reports. The author found that generating HTML or spreadsheet reports by the way vulnerabilities are sorted is the best way to view the results of the findings. When you sort out vulnerability results, you can save a lot of time by being able to see things more easily and clearly, such as the host or web page affected by each vulnerability, and you can more easily generate a final report or repair plan. Instead of looking at one host at a time.</p>
		<p>Using a vulnerability scanner to perform vulnerability scanning correctly is similar to using a digital SLR camera to take photos. Anyone can use this tool, but that doesn't mean you know how to use it effectively, and there's no guarantee of positive results.</p>
		<h2>Message authentication</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Definition</h3>
		<p>Message authentication refers to authentication through encryption or signature transformation of messages or information related to messages, in order to prevent messages transmitted and stored from being intentionally or unintentionally tampered with. Including message content authentication (that is, message integrity authentication), message source and persistent authentication (that is, identity authentication 0), and message sequence number and operation time authentication and so on. It has important applications in bill anti-counterfeiting (such as tax gold tax system and bank payment cipher).</p>
		<p>The digest algorithm used for message authentication is different from the general symmetric or asymmetric encryption algorithm. It is not used to prevent information from being stolen, but to prove the integrity and accuracy of the original text, that is to say, Message authentication is mainly used to prevent information from being tampered with.</p>
		<h3>Type</h3>
		<p>1.Message content authentication</p>
		<p>A common method of message content authentication: the message sender adds an authentication code (MAC, MDC, etc.) to the message and sends it to the recipient (sometimes just an encrypted authentication code). The receiver uses the agreed algorithm to authenticate the decrypted message and compares the obtained authentication code with the received authentication code. If the two codes are equal, they are received, otherwise they are refused to receive.</p>
		<p>2.Authentication of source and destination</p>
		<p>In message authentication, there are two common authentication methods: message source and destination.</p>
		<p>One is the data encryption key that the communication parties agree to send the message in advance. The receiver only needs to verify whether the sent message can be restored to plaintext with the key to identify the sender. If both parties use the same data encryption key, simply embed the sender identifier in the message.</p>
		<p>The other is that the communication parties implement the agreement to send the message. The sending message contains the pass word and encrypts it. The receiver only needs to judge whether the decrypted pass word in the message is equal to the agreed pass word to identify the sender. To be on the safe side, passwords should be variable.</p>
		<p>3.Authentication of message serial number and operation time</p>
		<p>The serial number and temporal authentication of the message is mainly to prevent the replay attack of the message. Common methods include message pipelining, link authenticator random tree authentication, timestamp and so on.</p>
		<h3>Common attacks and Countermeasures in message Authentication</h3>
		<p>1.Replay attack: intercepts information transmitted during the execution of a previous protocol and then uses it again at some point. One way to deal with this attack is to include a non-repetitive value in the authentication message, such as a serial number, a timestamp, a random number, or an embedded target identity marker.</p>
		<p>2.Impersonation attack: an attacker impersonates a legitimate user to publish false messages. Authentication techniques can be used to avoid such attacks.</p>
		<p>3.Recombination attack: an attack that recombines information transmitted one or more times during the execution of a previous protocol. To avoid such attacks, all messages running the protocol are connected together.</p>
		<p>4.Tampering attack: modify, delete, add or replace real messages. In order to avoid this attack, techniques such as message authentication code MAC or hash function can be used.</p>
