		<h1>Password(Symbolic system)</h1>
		<hr />
		<p>Passwords are a technique for confusion, and users want to turn normal (recognizable) information into unrecognizable information. But this unrecognized part of the information can be reprocessed and recovered and cracked. Password is a generic name for "password" in Chinese.</p>
		<p>The "password" entered when logging into websites, email addresses, and bank withdrawals should strictly be called a "password" because it is not an "encryption code" in the original sense, but it can also be called a secret number. It is mainly limited to a symbolic system that individuals understand (such as a message). Such as cipher telegram, cipher typewriter.</p>
		
		<h2>Citation interpretation</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>1. A specially compiled secret code. Used within the agreed scope to distinguish it from "clear code". "the strange situation witnessed in the past 20 years," the ninth and second time: "he personally produced a telegram of more than a hundred words, translated it with his own private password, sent it to the electricity bureau, and called his brother Huilu." Guo Moruo's Hongboqu, Chapter 15, Chapter 5: "but I can also guarantee that they will greatly adapt the coded telegram."</p>
		<p>2. Extension refers to secret information. Wang Meng "the Voice of Spring": "the melody of spring, the password of life, this is very precious."</p>
		<p>Passwords can refer to:</p>
		<p>Cryptography (cipher), ciphertext, an algorithm for encryption or decryption; cryptography;</p>
		<p>Password (authentication), is a password, a set of text used for authentication purposes;</p>
		<p>Password (video game), a string of data codes used in a video game to return to the game phase.</p>
		
		<h2>Name origin</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>In 405 BC, the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta in ancient Greece was coming to an end. The Spartan army gradually gained a dominant position and was ready to launch a final blow against Athens. At this time, the Persian Empire, who had been on the side of Sparta, suddenly changed its attitude and stopped its aid to Sparta in an attempt to make Athens and Sparta lose both in the ongoing war in order to profit from it. In this context, Sparta urgently needs to find out the specific action plan of the Persian Empire in order to adopt a new strategic approach. Just then, the Spartan army captured an Athenian messenger who returned to Athens from the Persian Empire. The Spartan soldiers searched the messenger, but for a long time they found nothing but an ordinary belt of disorderly Greek letters. Where on earth is the information hidden? Spartan army commander Lysander focused his attention on the belt, and the information must be in the clutter of the letters. He pondered over and over the heavenly book-like characters, rearranging and combining the letters on his belt in various ways, but he could not figure them out. In the end, Lysander lost confidence, and as he fiddled with the belt, he thought about other ways to get the information. A miracle occurred when he inadvertently spiraled his belt around the scabbard of his hand. It turned out that the messy letters on the belt formed a paragraph of writing. This was an intelligence sent back by Athenian spies, which told Athens that the Persian army was preparing to launch a final attack on the Spartan army when it suddenly attacked the Spartan army. On the basis of this intelligence, the Spartan army immediately changed its combat plan, first attacking the defenseless Persian army and defeating it in one fell swoop. Subsequently, the Spartan army returned to the division to conquer Athens and finally won the final victory of the war.</p>
		<p>The belt intelligence sent back by Athenian spies is the earliest password information in the world. The specific method of application is that the two sides of the communication first agree on the rules for interpreting passwords. Then the communication-side wraps the belt (or other things, such as sheepskin, etc.) around the stick of the agreed length and thickness. When you receive a letter, if you don't wrap your belt around a stick of the same length and thickness, you can only see some irregular letters. Later, this method of cryptographic communication was widely circulated in Greece. The modern coded telegram is said to have been invented by its inspiration.</p>
		<p>Eterbashi code is a system: the last letter represents the first letter and the penultimate letter represents the second letter.</p>
		<p>In the Roman alphabet, it appears like this.：</p>
		<p>Plaintext：a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z</p>
		<p>Ciphertext: Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M LK J I H G F E D C B A</p>
		<p>This code was discovered by Dr. Xiongfei. Dr. Xiong Fett was one of the first researchers of Comran's Dead Sea Scrolls. His most famous book in the study of the history of the Bible is the Passover conspiracy. He used this code to study verses that others could not decipher by other methods. This password was used to hide names in the scriptures of Essene / Sadoji / Nazareth in the 1st century AD. In fact, as early as 500 BC, it was used to write the Book of Jeremiah. Jeremiah was a Jewish prophet who lived between 627 BC and 586 BC. There are many records about him in the Old Testament. Before his death, Jewish territory had been occupied by the Babylonians. It is also one of several cryptographic systems used in Hebrew.</p>
		<p>Pigsty encryption, its English name is pigpen cipher. In the 18th century, Freemasons invented to make it impossible for others to understand what he wrote. The pigpen password belongs to the replacement cipher stream, but instead of one letter instead of another, it uses a symbol instead of a letter. Write 26 letters into the next four tables and encrypt them with the part of the table next to the letter.</p>
		
		<h2>Password composition</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>A password is a symbol compiled according to a specific rule that transforms the information of both sides of the communication. In other words, the password conceals the real content, that is, the information expressed in public and standard information coding is transformed into information coding that no one but the communicating parties can read. This unique information code is the password.</p>
		<p>Password is a science with a long history. Passwords were used to transmit secret messages in the war between ancient Greece and the Persian Empire. In modern and modern wars, the transmission of information and command of war can not be separated from the code, and the diplomatic struggle can not be separated from the code. Passwords are generally used for confidentiality in the process of information communication transmission and storage. With the development of computer and information technology, the development of cryptographic technology is also very rapid, and the application field is expanding. In addition to information encryption, passwords are also used for data information signature and security authentication. In this way, the application of password is no longer limited to the military and diplomatic struggle, it is also widely used in social and economic activities. Nowadays, there has been a trend of socialization and personalization of cryptographic applications in the world. For example, cryptographic technology can be applied to e-commerce to identify the identity and commercial credit of both sides of online transactions, so as to prevent "hackers" and fraud in online e-commerce. When applied to value-added tax invoices, it can prevent counterfeiting and tampering, put an end to all kinds of acts of stealing, leaking, evading and deceiving state taxes by using value-added tax invoices, and greatly facilitate tax inspection. When applied to bank check authentication, it can greatly reduce the financial crime of financial fraud by using false cheques, and greatly enhance the confidentiality of communication information when used in personal mobile communication.</p>
		<p>A number of documents decrypted by the British Security Service have shown the work of the British intelligence service to the world for the first time, Reuters reported. Deciphering the code in the skirt is one of the famous ones.</p>
		
		<h2>Cryptographic application</h2>
		<hr />
		<p><b>Hidden mystery in skirt</b></p>
		<p>During World War II, Nazi agents, after detecting classified allied military information, passed it on to their leaders, thus determining the course of their operations. Once, Allied inspectors intercepted a design drawing. On this design sketch are three young models wearing fashionable clothes.</p>
		<p>On the face of it, the design sketch seems common, but the seemingly "innocent" drawing failed to hide from the eyes of British counterespionage experts. British security officials saw through the tricks of Nazi agents and ordered code breakers and inspectors to decipher the codes quickly.</p>
		<p>A large number of enemy reinforcements may arrive at any time. Finally, the cipher deciphers read out such a message from the design drawing.</p>
		<p>It turned out that Nazi agents used the dots and long horizontal symbols of Morse code as passwords to make decorative patterns and hide them in patterns such as models' skirts, coats and hats.</p>
		
		<p><b>There are a variety of means</b></p>
		<p>The decrypted documents also show other ingenious ways for Nazi agents to transmit information. In order to disguise the intelligence as "seamless" and send it smoothly, Nazi agents were deliberate.</p>
		<p>Invisible ink, pinprick holes and the indentation of letters are all their usual tricks. Nazi agents used these hints to tell the army the details of military activities, bombardment attacks and warship construction.</p>
		<p>They will also hide passwords in loose-leaf music, descriptions that teach you to play chess, and shorthand symbols. The coded information was disguised as ordinary letters.</p>
		<p>Sometimes they thicken the postcard and fill the interlayer with extremely thin pieces of paper and paperwork. All sorts of strange tricks are unpreventable.</p>
		
		<p><b>The old horse stumbled too</b></p>
		<p>Nazi agents also used the alphabet to "cheat". It looks like an ordinary letter, but when you spell the first letter of each word, it's a "confidential information."</p>
		<p>Two German agents were arrested in 1942 and confessed to British intelligence about how to hide the code. On both occasions, however, the British intelligence services missed such confidential documents and allowed the intelligence to circulate. The reason is that they do not think that there will be such a way to hide information in the future, so they do not treat the two letters as confidential documents.</p>
		<p>The password is hidden in a letter from Hubert to Aunt Janet. The hidden intelligence in the letter is that "14 Boeing fortress bombers arrived in London yesterday. The pilot will strike Kiel (German city).</p>
		<p>David Petrie, the head of British wartime intelligence reconnaissance, awkwardly admitted that the two defeats were "a bit annoying".</p>
		<p>But with the development of the war, counter-espionage officials have also invented a variety of methods to detect suspicious letters!</p>
		<p>Well-documented Nazi agent letters usually include:</p>
		<p>1. The text was scattered and unfocused, the letter was sent to a neutral country and the envelope was affixed with a large number of stamps.</p>
		<p>2. The difficult and little-used phrase in the letter is one of the hallmarks of the hidden password.</p>
		<p>3. The list of people in the letter and large paragraphs about bridge can also raise doubts.</p>
		
		<h2>Encryption method</h2>
		<hr />
		<p><b>RSA algorithm</b></p>
		<p>RSA algorithm is the first algorithm that can be used for both encryption and digital signature, and it is easy to understand and operate. RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm, the so-called asymmetric, that is, the algorithm needs a pair of keys, using one encryption, you need to use the other to decryp.</p>
		
		<p><b>ECC encryption method</b></p>
		<p>ECC algorithm is also an algorithm that can be used for encryption and digital signature at the same time, and it is also easy to understand and operate. Like the RSA algorithm, the asymmetric cryptographic algorithm uses one encryption and decrypts it with the other.</p>
		
		<p><b>Two-square password</b></p>
		<p>Two-square_cipher use fewer matrices than quadrilateral passwords. The encryption matrix is obtained in the same way as a quadrilateral password.</p>
		
		<p><b>Quadrilateral password</b></p>
		<p>The quadrilateral cipher is encrypted with four 5 × 5 matrices. Each matrix has 25 letters (usually cancel Q or treat I, J as the same, or improve to a 6 × 6 matrix with 10 numbers).</p>
		
		<p><b>Ternary code</b></p>
		<p>First, create a random 3 × 3 Polybius box instead of password, including 26 English letters and a symbol. Then write out the three-dimensional coordinates of the message to be encrypted. The message and coordinates are arranged in four columns, and then the horizontal numbers are taken in order, and the three numbers are separated into groups of three. The three numbers are used as coordinates to find the corresponding letters, and the ciphertext is obtained.</p>
		
		<p><b>Fence encryption method</b></p>
		<p>Fence encryption is a simple and fast encryption method. Fence encryption is to write the file to be encrypted according to the way it is written up and down, and then arrange the text of the second line after the first line.</p>
