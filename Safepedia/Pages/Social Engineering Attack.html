		<h1>Social Engineering Attack</h1>
		<hr />
		<p>Social engineering attack is a kind of network attack behavior which is carried out by using "social engineering".</p>
		<p>In computer science, social engineering refers to the way in which one's psychology is affected, some actions are made, or some confidential information is disclosed through legal communication with others. This is often considered to be an act of deceiving others to collect information, cheat, and invade computer systems. In the Anglo-American common law system, this act is generally regarded as an infringement of the right to privacy.</p>
		<p>Historically, social engineering belongs to sociology, but its effect on the psychology of others has attracted the attention of computer security experts.</p>
		
		<h2>Brief introduction</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Social engineering, to be exact, is not a science, but an art and trick. Social engineering takes advantage of human weaknesses in ways that allow you to fall for it in a way that complies with your wishes and satisfies your desires, an art and a knowledge. It is not science because it does not always repeat and succeed, and when there is enough information, it automatically fails. The tricks of social engineering also contain a variety of flexible ideas and changing factors. Social engineering is a method to make use of human weaknesses such as instinctive reaction, curiosity, trust, greed and other weaknesses to obtain their own interests, such as deception, injury and other harmful means.</p>
		<p>In reality, there are many crimes using social engineering. SMS fraud, such as fraud of bank credit card numbers, telephone fraud, such as selling fraud in the name of celebrities, are used in social engineering.</p>
		<p>In recent years, more and more hackers have turned to the use of human weaknesses, that is, social engineering methods to carry out network attacks. The use of social engineering means to break through the information security defense measures, has shown a rising or even flooding trend.</p>
		<p>Rich Mogull, director of information security and risk research at Gartner Group, said: "Social engineering is the biggest security risk in the next 10 years, and many of the most destructive behaviors are caused by social engineering rather than hacking or sabotage." Some information security experts predict that social engineering will be an important confrontation field of information system intrusion and anti-intrusion in the future.</p>
		
		<h2>Terminology</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>The term all social engineering attacks are based on cognitive bias in decision-making. Sometimes these deviations are called "human hardware vulnerabilities" and are sufficient to produce a number of attacks, some of which include:</p>
		
		<h3>Pretexting</h3>
		<p>Pretexting is a means of creating false situations to force victims to disclose information that they do not want to disclose. This method usually presupposes the study of specific terms for special situations in order to establish a reasonable and reasonable illusion.</p>
		<h3>Diversion Theft</h3>
		<h3>IVR/Phone phishing, IVR:interactive voice response</h3>
		<h3>Baiting</h3>
		<h3>Quid pro quo</h3>
		<p>Quid pro quo attackers disguised as internal technicians or questionnaire investigators, asking the other party to give key information such as passwords. In a 2003 information security survey, 90% of office workers agreed to give their passwords in exchange for a cheap pen that investigators claimed to provide. Follow-up surveys have also found that chocolate and other small temptations such as other small temptations can get the same results (the password validity is not tested). Attackers can also disguise themselves as corporate technical support personnel to "help" solve technical problems, quietly implant malicious programs or steal information.</p>
		<h3>Tailgating or Piggybacking</h3>
		<p>Tailgating or Piggybacking usually means that the follower uses the identification mechanism of another legally authorized person to enter a restricted area through certain checkpoints.</p>
		
		<h2>Methods</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Social engineering attacks are spread in different forms and through a variety of attack vectors. This is an art that keeps improving and developing rapidly. However, some misunderstandings of social engineering attacks still occur from time to time, as shown below.</p>
		<p>Fake an email from a friend: this is a common way to use social engineering strategies to grab information from a large number of online people. In this case, the attacker simply hacks into an email account and sends an email containing spyware to another address book in the contact list. It is worth emphasizing that email attachments or links from acquaintances are often believed, which makes it easy for attackers to get it.</p>
		<p>In most cases, an attacker uses the victim's account to send you an email claiming that your "friend" was caught abroad as a result of a robbery while traveling. They need a sum of money to pay for the return ticket and promise to return it as soon as they get back. Often, emails contain guidelines on how to remit money to your "trapped foreign friends."</p>
		<p>Fishing attack: this is an old trick to use social engineering strategies to obtain confidential information about victims. Most phishing attacks are disguised as trusted service providers such as banks, schools, software companies, or government security agencies, such as FBI.</p>	
		<p>Often, cyber swindlers pretend to be trusted service providers to send emails, asking you to update your account information or upgrade your existing software as soon as possible through a given link. Most phishing requires you to do something right away, or you will bear some dangerous consequences. Clicking on the link embedded in the email will take you to a fake website designed to steal your login credentials.</p>	
		<p>Another common method used by anglers is to email you claiming that you have won the lottery or can get some promotional items, asking you to provide bank information in order to receive the lottery money. In some cases, swindlers impersonating FBI indicate that you have recovered your "stolen money" and therefore need you to provide bank information while getting the money back.</p>
		<p>Bait Scheme: in this type of social engineering conspiracy, attackers take advantage of the super-high attention of people, such as the latest movies or popular MV, to mine information about these people. This is common in P2P sharing networks such as Bit torrent.</p>
		<p>Another popular way is to sell hot goods at a discount of 15%. Such a strategy can easily be used to fake legitimate auction sites such as eBay, and it is easy for users to take the bait. The items provided in the email usually do not exist, and attackers can use your eBay account to obtain your bank information.</p>
		<p>Proactively provide technical support: in some cases, an attacker impersonates a technical support team from a company such as Microsoft to respond to your request to solve a technical problem. Although you have never sought such help, you will try to enjoy such a "free service" by clicking on the link in the email because you are having technical problems with Microsoft products.</p>
		<p>Once you reply to such an email, you establish an interaction with an attacker who wants to know more about the details of your computer system. In some cases, the attacker will ask you to log on to their company system or simply seek access to your system. Sometimes they issue fake commands to run on your system. And these commands are just to give attackers greater access to your computer system.</p>
		
		<h2>Avoidance measures</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Beware of emails, instant messages, and phone calls from service providers and others of unknown origin. Verify the reliability and authority of any personal information before providing it.</p>
		<p>Browse the details of emails and text messages slowly and carefully. Don't let the urgency of the attacker's message hinder your judgment.</p>
		<p>Self-study. Information is the most powerful tool to prevent social engineering attacks. Study how to identify and defend against network attackers.</p>
		<p>Never click on an embedded link in an email from an unknown sender. If necessary, use the search engine to find the target site or enter the site URL manually.</p>
		<p>Never download an attachment from an email from an unknown sender. If necessary, you can open attachments in the protection view, which is enabled by default in many operating systems.</p>
		<p>Turn down online computer technology help from strangers, no matter how legitimate they claim to be.</p>
		<p>Use a powerful firewall to protect your computer space, update antivirus software in a timely manner and raise the threshold for spam filters.</p>
		<p>Download software and operating system patches to prevent zero-day vulnerabilities. Follow the patches released by the software vendor and install the patch version as quickly as possible.</p>
		<p>Follow the URL of the site. Sometimes swindlers on the Internet have made minor changes to URL, inducing traffic into their own fraudulent websites.</p>
		
		<h2>Remedial method</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Because of the gentle nature of social engineering attacks, most victims do not know that they have been attacked, and it may take months to discover the security breach. Once you suspect you are a victim of a social engineering attack, the first thing you need to do is reset a password.</p>
		<p>Create a new strong password for all your accounts, and make sure your new password has nothing to do with your family, as the attacker may know a lot about you and your family. Second, contact your bank and carefully examine your financial statements. Finally, consideration could be given to reporting to the relevant functional bodies in order to avoid potential identity theft and false mail fraud.</p>
		
		<h2>Related books</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Kevin Mitnick's The Art of Deception, is a classic of social engineering. The book describes in detail many ways to invade networks using social engineering, which do not require much technical foundation, but the scary thing is that once you know how to take advantage of human weaknesses such as credulity, forgetfulness, timidity, greed, etc., You can easily sneak into the most heavily protected network systems. He used to be able to make the best of the day at a very young age. Like magic, unwittingly entered the US Department of Defense, IBM and other almost impossible to sneak into the network system, and obtained the administrator privileges.</p>
		<p>The recent popularity of free downloads of software bundled with rogue software, free music with viruses, phishing, spyware in spam, and so on, are all recent representative applications of social engineering.</p>
		<p>Social engineering attack is not the category of traditional information security, also known as "Nontraditional Information Security".</p>
		<p>Traditional information security methods can not solve the threat of non-traditional information security. It is generally believed that to solve the threat of non-traditional information security, we should also use social engineering to counter social engineering attacks. China Network S3 host security system, the use of social engineering to counter social engineering attacks. The concrete method is to provide the user with sufficient feedback information, so that the user can make accurate judgment, avoid being fooled, and add more control mechanisms, even in the case of wrong decision-making. It can also prevent social engineering attacks.</p>
		<p>How to avoid becoming a victim?</p>
		<p>Be careful of unexplained calls, accesses, or email messages from individuals asking about employees or other internal information. If an individual you do not know claims to be from a legitimate institution, please try to confirm his or her identity directly with that body.</p>
		<p>Unless you are sure that someone is entitled to such information, do not give him personal information or information about your organization, including the organizational structure and network of your organization.</p>
		<p>Do not divulge personal or financial information in email, do not respond to emails asking for such information, and do not click on links in such emails.</p>
		<p>Do not send confidential information on the network until you check the security of a website.</p>
		<p>Note the URL address of a website. A malicious website can look the same as a legitimate website, but its URL address may use a modified spelling or domain name (for example, changing .com to. Net).</p>
		<p>What should you do if you think you have been endangered?</p>
		<p>If you are sure you have leaked confidential information about your organization, report it to the appropriate personnel in your organization, including your network administrator. In this way they can be vigilant against suspicious or abnormal activities.</p>
		<p>If you are convinced that your financial account has been compromised, please contact your financial institution quickly and close the account that may have been compromised. Observe any unexplained charges in your account.</p>
		<p>Please consider reporting the attack to the police and sending a report to the relevant security agencies.</p>
