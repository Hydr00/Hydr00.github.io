		<h1>Social Engineering</h1>
		<hr />
		<p>Social engineering in the 1960s or so as a formal discipline. The definition of social engineering in a broad sense is to establish a theory and gradually solve a variety of complex social problems by using natural, social and institutional approaches. After years of application and development, social engineering has gradually produced branches of discipline. Such as public security social engineering (referred to as public security social engineering) and network social engineering.</p>
		
		<h2>Origin</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Kevin Mitnick, the world's number one hacker, mentioned in the Art of Anti-deception that human factors are the weakness of security. Many enterprises and companies invest a lot of money in information security, and the ultimate cause of data leakage is often in the people themselves. You may never imagine that, for hackers, through a user name, a string of numbers, a string of English codes, social engineers can screen and sort them out through these clues, through social worker attacks. You will be able to grasp all your personal information, family status, hobbies, marital status, all traces of what you have left on the Internet, and so on. Although this is probably the most inconspicuous, but also the most troublesome way. A kind of hacker technique which does not need to rely on any hacker software and pays more attention to the study of human weakness is on the rise, that is, social engineering hacking technology.</p>
		
		<h2>Main contents</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Social Engineeringï¼ŒIt is a non-technical infiltration means to obtain information through interpersonal communication. Unfortunately, this approach is very effective and highly efficient to apply. In fact, social engineering is already one of the biggest threats to corporate security.</p>
		
		<h2>Social work means</h2>
		<hr />
		<h3>1.Acquaintances are easy to talk to</h3>
		<p>This is the most widely used method among social engineers, and the principle goes something like this. Social engineers first become classmates, colleagues, friends, and so on that you often come into contact with by various means (including camouflage), and then, gradually, The identity he disguises is recognized by other colleagues in your company, so that social engineers often visit your company and eventually win the trust of anyone. As a result, social engineers can get a lot of authority in your company to implement some of their plans. For example, access to office areas or confidential areas that should not have been allowed, or access to the office after work, and so on.</p>
		
		<h3>2.Falsify similar information background</h3>
		<p>When you start meeting people who seem familiar with the inside of your organization and have some undisclosed information, it's easy to think of them as one of your own. So it's easy for strangers to get permits when they enter your office in the name of a company or an employee. But in today's society, from a variety of social networks, purposeful, targeted access to specific personal information is too easy. Therefore, I suggest that if anyone claims to be very familiar with a colleague, especially a superior leader, the employee can be asked to wait in the designated area and not to give any permission casually.</p>
		
		<h3>3.Pretending to be a newcomer and breaking into the inside</h3>
		<p>If they want to obtain some confidential information about the company with great certainty, social engineers can also disguise themselves as a stranger looking for a job, thus making themselves "one of their own" for the company. This is one of the reasons why every new employee has to go through the background check phase of the company. Of course, there are still some social engineers who are deceiving, so there should also be restrictions in the working environment of new employees, which sounds harsh, but each new employee must be given some time to prove it. They are trustworthy of the valuable core assets of the company. Even so, good social engineers are familiar with the company's workflow, so they will not really implement their goal plan until they have full trust at the corporate level.</p>
		
		<h3>4.Take advantage of the interview opportunity</h3>
		<p>Similarly, a lot of important information is often leaked during interviews, and hackers who are proficient in social engineering seize this and take advantage of it. They don't have to go to a day's class to get this information. You can go to an interview. Get some important information about the company. Therefore, it is suggested that the company needs to ensure that some of the information given during the interview does not contain company confidential information, and try to make some interview criteria to protect the company's core secrets.</p>
		
		<h3>5.The wicked have no taboos</h3>
		<p>This may sound counterintuitive, but it does work. Ordinary people tend to stay away from people who show anger and viciousness, and when they see someone in front of them arguing loudly with a cell phone or cursing angrily, many people choose to avoid them and stay away from them. In fact, most people would probably do so, giving social engineers a way to access internal and core data. Don't be deceived by this trick. Once you see something like this happen, just call security.</p>
		
		<h3>6.He knows me like a worm in my stomach</h3>
		<p>An experienced social engineer is adept at reading and using the body language of others. He may appear at the same time as you at a concert, enjoy a certain segment as much as you do, and always give you appropriate feedback when communicating with you, making you feel as if you have met a confidant! You start to build a two-way open bond with him, and slowly, he starts to influence you and use you to get everything that's useful to him about your company. It sounds like a spy story, but in fact, it often happens to us. Don't take it lightly.</p>
		
		<h3>7.Beauty plan</h3>
		<p>Our ancestors mentioned the beauty trick a long time ago, but most of the time, most people can't resist it. Just like our dream plot in movies and TV dramas, suddenly one day, a handsome guy (or beautiful woman) suddenly asked you out. During that time, the two of you hit it off as soon as you met and talked and laughed a lot. What's more, after meeting, Dates followed until she could easily get the company's confidential information out of your mouth as if she were talking about eating. I'm not trying to get rid of your romance, but there's no pie in the sky, so beware of those who ask questions that shouldn't be asked.</p>
		
		<h3>8.Foreign monks can recite scriptures</h3>
		<p>This is already happening. A social engineering attacker often acts as a technical consultant who acquires your personal information while completing some of the consultant's work. This is especially true for technical consultants. You must review these technical advisers and make sure that they are not given any opportunity to divulge secrets. Just because someone has the ability to help you solve server or network problems, just because they trust others doesn't mean they won't use it to create a backdoor program or copy all the confidential data on your computer. Therefore, the key is to review, review, re-examine.</p>
		
		<h3>9.Kindness is the epitaph of the good</h3>
		<p>This method is simple and so common. Social engineers will wait for the opportunity, waiting for their target employees to open the door with their own password to enter, right behind them, into the company. They cleverly carried heavy boxes and asked their target staff to hold the doorknobs for them. Good employees usually help them at the door. Social engineers can then begin to carry out their own tasks.</p>
		
		<h3>10.Have a technical exchange</h3>
		<p>There is a scene in the movie "Hackers" in which Dade (also called Zero Cool)) calls a company and persuades an employee to give him the number of modems, and this conversation is his main infiltration job. The hapless employee will naturally tell him any confidential information he needs to know. This is an ordinary social worker attack. When unguarded employees encounter well-prepared and carefully disguised hackers, most people have no experience in dealing with social engineering attacks. To divulge all the confidential information that the social engineer wants.</p>
		
		<h2>Defense means</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>In the actual case of social engineering attack, if the user is not allowed to enable macros, the attack may not have such a big impact. Li Dongwei, an information security engineer, says companies can use deep packet detection technology (DPI), behavioral analysis and threat intelligence to monitor abnormal behavior at the network layer, such as working documents with macroviruses shown in a social worker attack case. Enterprises can use next-generation terminal security technologies to perform similar functions on endpoint devices, which will help mitigate many social engineering attacks.</p>
		<p>Li Dongwei further added that enterprises should force the application of network segment scanning, multi-factor authentication, and evidence chain forensics after attacks on networks and endpoints to prevent horizontal infection and limit the loss caused by stolen vouchers. And understand the scope of violations to ensure that all related malware is removed.</p>
		<p>And targeted extortion means, enterprises should combine the minimum authority zero trust measures and behavior detection to solve the problem of extortion, and monitor the attack behavior and limit the abuse of leaked documents and so on. If cybercriminals attack and extort employees, the extortion information is most likely corporate sensitive data. At this time, the law, human resources and law enforcement departments need to play a role, the cultivation of staff prevention awareness and coping skills play a very obvious role in reducing losses.</p>
		<p>To detect spies who infiltrate the company under the guise of work, consider employees who have never been on leave or even sick leave, because they may worry that their activities will be detected after they leave the company.</p>
		<p>The attack methods against malicious robots can use tools such as abnormal behavior monitoring products and some anti-virus and anti-malware tools to effectively detect the behavior of malicious robots and their changes to the browser. Businesses can also use threat intelligence software and network IP address trust information to detect malicious robots.</p>
