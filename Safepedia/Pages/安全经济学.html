		<h1>Safety Economics</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>Safety Economics</p>
		<h2>Connotation</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>1.The research object of safety economics is the economic form and condition of safety, that is, through theoretical research and analysis, it reveals and expounds the expression forms and realization conditions of safety interest, safety investment and safety benefit.</p>
		<p>2.The purpose of safety economics is to realize the best safety benefit of human, technology and environment.</p>
		<p>3.The goal of safety economics is achieved by controlling and adjusting human security activities.</p>
		<h2>Layers</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>1.Philosophy: It can be divided into 3 parts:Safety economy view, Safety economic epistemology and Safety economic methodology.</p>
		<p>2.Basic Sciences: It can be divided into 5 parts:Macroeconomics, microeconomics, quantitative economics, systems science and mathematics.</p>
		<p>3.Technical science: It can be divided into 3 parts:Safety economic principle, safety economic prediction theory and safety economic analysis theory.</p>
		<p>4.Engineering technology: It can be divided into 4 parts:Research methods and means of safety economic technology, safety economic policy and decision-making, safety economic standards and safety economic statistics.</p>
		<h2>Characteristics</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>1.Systematic: security and economic problems are often multi-objective, multi-variable complex problems.</p>
		<p>2.Predictability: the output of security economy is often delayed and lagged, while the nature of security activities is advanced and preventive.</p>
		<p>3.Optimality: the decision-making activities of safety and economy should be based on optimization. Safety economics should provide techniques and methods for optimizing safety economy.</p>
		<p>4.Sectorality: security economics has a specific application field (security field)</p>
		<p>5.Fringe: safety economics is the marginal science of the intersection of safe natural science and safe social science. It is not only restricted by natural science, but also dominated by economic science.</p>
		<p>6.Application: the safety economic problems studied by safety economics have strong technology and application. Safety economics provides technology and means for this practice.</p>
		<h2>Important factors</h2>
		<hr>
		<h3>Safety benefit</h3>
		<p>Through the security input to achieve specific security conditions and reach a specific security level, the effect and benefits to the user.</p>
		<h4>·Economic safety benefit</h4>
		<p>1.To reduce the benefit, that is, to reduce the loss.</p>
		<p>2.Maintain network systems to create value</p>
		<h4>·Social safety benefit</h4>
		<p>Positive impact on the state, society, units and individuals</p>
		<h3>Safety investment</h3>
		<p>The sum of the investments of all people, money, and things in safety and security activities</p>
		<h4>·Types</h4>
		<p>1.Roles division: preventive and controlled investment</p>
		<p>2.Chronological division: pre-disaster investment, disaster investment, post-disaster investment</p>
		<p>3.Product division: hardware investment and software investment</p>
		<p>4.Use division: engineering construction, personnel business, scientific research investment</p>
		<h4>·Methods</h4>
		<p>1.System forecasting: using data for systematic forecasting to determine the amount of investment</p>
		<p>2.Historical comparison: combined with existing methods to take into account the current situation</p>
		<p>3.International comparason: reference to the methods of other countries</p>
		<h3>Safety value</h3>
		<p>The ratio of "safety function" to "safety input".</p>
		<h4>·The point of view of improving the value of security</h4>
		<p>1.Economic point of view: quantify non-economic things on an economic scale as much as possible. </p>
		<p>2.Systematic point of view: using a systematic approach to analyze and solve problems. </p>
		<p>3.Long-term view: everything has to be seen from a distance. </p>
		<p>4.Dynamic point of view: to learn to adapt to the situation, according to the time, object changes to dynamically solve the problem.</p>
