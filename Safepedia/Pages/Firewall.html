		<h2>What is Firewall</h2>
		<hr>
		<p> <b>Firewall</b>，Firewall technology is an organic combination of all kinds of software and hardware equipment for security management and screening to help computer networks build a relatively isolated protection barrier between their internal and external networks. A technique used to protect the security of user information and information.</p>
		<p>
			The main function of firewall technology is to find and deal with the possible security risks and data transmission problems in the operation of computer network in time, among which the processing measures include isolation and protection. At the same time, it can record and detect the operations in the computer network security, in order to ensure the security of the computer network operation, ensure the integrity of user information and information, and provide users with a better and more secure experience of using the computer network.</p>

		<h2>Function</h2>
		<hr>
		<p> 1、Intrusion detection function：
			One of the main functions of network firewall technology is the function of intrusion detection. It mainly has the functions of anti-port scanning, detecting denial of service tools, detecting CGI/IIS server intrusion, detecting Trojan horse or network worm attack, detecting buffer overflow attack and so on, which can greatly reduce the intrusion of network threat factors. Effectively block most network security attacks.</p>
		<p> 2、Network address translation function：
			Using firewall technology can effectively realize the IP address translation of internal network or external network, which can be divided into source address translation and destination address translation, that is, SNAT and NAT. SNAT is mainly used to hide the internal network structure, avoid illegal access and malicious attacks from external networks, and effectively alleviate the shortage of address space, while DNAT is mainly used by public network hosts to access private network hosts. To avoid attacks on the internal network.</p>
		<p> 3、Audit monitoring function of network operation: through this function, all operations and security information of system management can be recorded effectively, statistical data about network usage can be provided, and it is convenient for computer network management to track information.</p>
		<p> 4、Strengthen the network security service: the firewall technology management can realize the centralized security management, assemble the security system on the firewall, and realize the supervision of the network information security in the way of information access.</p>
		<h2>Importance</h2>
		<hr>
		<p> 1、Record data information in a computer network</p>
		<p> 2、Prevent staff from accessing websites with security risks</p>
		<p> 3、Control of insecure services</p>
		<h2>Functional type</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>
			（1）Filtering firewall: filtering firewall is in the network layer and transport layer, can be based on the address of the data source and protocol type and other logo characteristics to determine whether it can be passed. In compliance with the firewall standards, meet the security performance and type of information can be transmitted, and some unsafe factors will be filtered and blocked by the firewall.</p>
		<p>
			（2）Application proxy Type Firewall: The main scope of application proxy firewall is at the highest level of OIS, above the application layer. Its main feature is that it can completely isolate the network communication flow and realize the supervision and control of the application layer through a specific agent. These two kinds of firewalls are more commonly used firewalls, and some other firewall applications are also more effective. In practical application, it is necessary to integrate specific requirements and reasonably choose the type of firewall. Only in this way can we effectively avoid the external intrusion of the firewall and other problems.</p>
		<p>
			（3）Composite: at present, the widely used firewall technology is compound firewall technology, which combines the advantages of packet filtering firewall technology and application proxy firewall technology. For example, the security policy sent is packet filtering policy. Then the access control can be carried out for the header part of the message. If the security policy is a proxy policy, access control can be carried out according to the content data of the message, so the composite firewall technology combines the advantages of its components and abandons the original shortcomings of the two firewalls. It greatly improves the flexibility and security of firewall technology in application practice.</p>
		<h2>Deployment mode</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>1. Bridge mode：
			Bridge mode can also be called transparent mode. The simplest network consists of a client and a server, which are on the same network segment. For security reasons, firewall devices are added between the client and the server to securely control the traffic passing through. A normal client request is delivered to the server through a firewall, and the server returns the response to the client, and the user does not feel the presence of the intermediate device. The firewall working in bridge mode does not have IP address. When expanding the capacity of the network, there is no need to replan the network address, but at the expense of routing, VPN and other functions.</p>
		<p>2.Gateway mode: the gateway mode is suitable for situations where the internal and external networks are not in the same network segment. The firewall sets the gateway address to realize the function of the router and routes and forwards for different network segments. Compared with the bridge mode, the gateway mode has higher security, realizes the security isolation while carrying on the access control, and has a certain degree of privacy.</p>
		<p>3.The NAT mode: NAT (Network Address Translation) address translation technology uses the firewall to translate the IP address of the internal network, and uses the IP address of the firewall to replace the source address of the internal network to send data to the external network. When the response data traffic from the external network is returned to the firewall, the firewall replaces the destination address with the source address of the internal network. NAT mode can realize that the external network can not see the IP address of the internal network directly, which further enhances the security protection of the internal network. At the same time, in the NAT mode network, the internal network can use the private network address, which can solve the problem of the limited number of IP addresses.</p>
		<p>4.High reliability design:
			Firewalls are deployed at the entrances and exits of the network, which is the gate of network communication, which requires the deployment of firewalls must have high reliability. The service life of general IT equipment is designed to be 3 to 5 years. When a single point of equipment fails, the reliability can be realized by redundancy technology, and the master and standby redundancy can be realized by such technologies as virtual routing redundancy protocol (VRRP). At present, the mainstream network devices support high reliability design.</p>

		<h2>Future trend</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>With the continuous improvement of software and hardware processing capacity and network bandwidth, the data processing capacity of firewall is also being improved. Especially in recent years, the development of multimedia streaming technology (online video) requires that the processing delay of firewall must be smaller and smaller. Based on the above business requirements, firewall manufacturers have developed firewall products based on network processors and ASIC (ApplicationSpecificIntegratedCircuits,-based ASIC. In essence, the firewall based on network processor still depends on the solution of the software system, so the performance of the software directly affects the performance of the firewall. The firewall products based on ASIC have customized and programmable hardware chips and matching software systems, so the advantages of performance are self-evident, and can well meet the requirements of customers for system flexibility and high performance.</p>
