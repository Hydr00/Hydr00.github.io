		<h1>Black Hat Hacker</h1>
		<hr />
		<p>Black Hat Hacker</p>
		<h2>Definition</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Black Hat Hacker, that is "craker". "cracker" can also refer to: In information security, "cracker" refers to a person who studies intelligent computer security systems. Using public communication networks, such as the Internet and telephone systems, the term "cracker", known as black hat hacker (also known as cracker), loaded into each other's systems without permission, was first used to refer to people who studied the embezzlement of telephone systems. 
	In the field of amateur computers, "cracker" refers to amateurs who study and modify computer products. In the 1970s, many of these communities focused on hardware research, and in the 1980 and 1990s, many focused on software changes (such as writing game modules, overcoming software copyright restrictions). 
	A "hacker" is "a person who is keen to study the internal workings of systems and computers, especially networks." 
	Hackers are not fixed who, each of us can become hackers, as long as you know some relevant network and computer knowledge. Knowledge accumulation to a certain extent, you can become a hacker, hackers are not necessarily bad people, most experts abide by network ethics and norms, but a small number of people destroy other people's computers to achieve their own goals.</p>
		<h2>Supplement</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>In reality, cracker is the chief culprit for making the Internet a mess. The so-called cracker is to use some existing programs to enter other people's computer system to find security vulnerabilities, and use these vulnerabilities to destroy your website, let you make a fool of yourself; There are also those who specialize in deciphering software passwords to make pirated software is also a kind of hackers, it can be said that such serious piracy in China is also the "work" of hackers. Cracker is not as scary as you might think. Many people think of cybercrime when they mention it, which is completely unnecessary. Cracker are just trying to show off their technology, and most people mean no harm. They may not have very high technology, but they have the psychology of the old urchin Zhou Boltong. They always like to joke with you. They usually use some simple attack methods to engage in BBS, chat rooms, and so on. In spite of this, there is still no shortage of sinister people who use their own technology to commit cybercrime.</p>
		<h2>Behavior</h2>
		<hr />
		<h3>Programming</h3>
		<p>The hacker software we use is written by this kind of people, and those abominable viruses. Most of them are programmers and are not familiar with the Internet. But they all have a solid computer skills and excellent programming skills, is a very good computer talent. They will take advantage of their own advantages to write a lot of useful software to make our network world richer, but also can make our intrusion easier.</p>
		<h3>Cracking</h3>
		<p>This is a branch formed a long time ago. The main work of these people is to crack the password of the trial version of the software, so that the software becomes truly free software. These people actually master programming skills, and they are more experienced in cracking passwords and decompiling. The essence of the hacker spirit is reflected in the work of these people, turning any software into free software and sharing it for free download.</p>
		<h3>Invasion</h3>
		<p>Many people understand hackers as intruders, but do not realize that intrusion is only a division of labor in the hacker group. Hackers invade in order to better understand the network, they continue to invade, find loopholes, solve it. Although their behavior is not allowed by the server owner, their behavior is for the security of the network. Intrusion is the most introduced on the network of a hacker branch, we also know more about him, I do not say anything more. But you should be careful, enter other people's mainframe, do not plan for a moment, delete what should not be deleted. Doing so will be looked down upon by real hackers and may lead to unnecessary trouble.</p>
		<h3>Maintaining</h3>
		<p>There are attacks and defenses, and one group of people are experts who specialize in network maintenance. They know a lot about how hackers attack, and it is common for them to fix loopholes. It can be said that they are stronger than the intruders and know more about our network. Because, intruders can attack different sites and hosts in one way. One of them succeeded, and his invasion was a success. And maintenance personnel to guard against the attack of many hackers, there is a failure, that is, failure. It's like the difference between a striker and a goalkeeper on the football field. Forward, attack the city and pull out the village, everyone wants to be. The goalkeeper stands silently in front of his own side, protecting his goal, but usually the goalkeeper is the most physically fit in a team. </p>
		<p>In these four types of work, there can be a different division of labor, but according to their own circumstances.</p>
		<h2>The working process of crackers</h2>
		<hr />
		<h3>1. Collect information in the network system</h3>
		<p>The collection of information does not harm the target, but only provides useful information for further intrusion. Crackers may use the following public protocols or tools to collect information about individual host systems that reside in a network system</p>
		<h3>2. Detecting the security vulnerabilities of the target network system</h3>
		<p>After gathering some information ready to attack the target, Crackers detects each host on the target network to look for security vulnerabilities within the system</p>
		<h3>3. Establish a simulated environment and carry out simulated attacks.</h3>
		<p>According to the information obtained from the first two small points, a simulation environment similar to the attack object is established, and then a series of attacks are carried out on the simulated target. During this period, by checking the logs of the attacked party and observing the response of the detection tool to the attack, we can further understand the "marks" left in the attack process and the status of the attacked party, so as to develop a more detailed attack strategy.</p>
		<h3>4. Specific implementation of network attacks</h3>
		<p>According to the information obtained in the previous steps, the intruder summarizes the corresponding attack methods according to his own level and experience. After the practice of simulation attack, the intruder will wait for the opportunity to implement the real network attack.</p>
