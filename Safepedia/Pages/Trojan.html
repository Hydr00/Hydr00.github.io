		<h1>Trojan</h1>
		<hr />
		<p>Trojan refers to a piece of malicious code with special functions hidden in the normal program. It is a backdoor program with special functions such as destroying and deleting files, sending passwords, recording keyboards, and attacking Dos. Trojan horse virus is actually a computer hacker used to remotely control the computer program, the control program parasitic in the controlled computer system, inside and outside, the computer infected with Trojan horse virus to carry out the operation. The general Trojan horse virus program is mainly to find the back door of the computer, waiting for the opportunity to steal passwords and important files in the controlled computer. Illegal operations such as monitoring and data modification can be carried out on the controlled computer. Trojan horse virus has very strong concealment, can launch an attack suddenly according to hacker intention.</p>
		
		<h2>Meaning</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Computer Trojan refers to a piece of malicious code with special functions hidden in normal programs. It is a backdoor program with special functions such as destroying and deleting files, sending passwords, recording keyboards, and attacking Dos.</p>
		<p>Trojans are ostensibly harmless and even attractive to unalerted users. They are often hidden in games or graphics software, but they hide malice. After these seemingly friendly programs run, they take illegal actions, such as deleting files or formatting the hard disk.</p>
		<p>The complete Trojan horse program is generally composed of two parts: one is the server side. One is the controller side. "Trojan horse" refers to the installation of a Trojan server-side program, if your computer is installed with a server-side program, then the corresponding client can control your computer through the network. do as one pleases. At this time, the various files and programs on your computer, as well as the accounts and passwords used on your computer, are no longer secure.</p>
		
		<h2>Development Course</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Trojan program technology development can be said to be very rapid. Mainly some young people out of curiosity, or eager to show their strength, continue to improve the writing of Trojan programs. So far, the Trojan has undergone six generations of improvements:</p>
		<p>The first generation is the most primitive Trojan horse program. Mainly simple password theft, e-mail messages, etc., with the most basic functions of Trojans.</p>
		<p>In the second generation, great progress has been made in technology, and Glacier is one of the typical representatives of Chinese Trojans.</p>
		<p>The third generation, mainly improved in the data transmission technology, the emergence of ICMP and other types of Trojans, the use of abnormal messages to transmit data, increasing the difficulty of anti-virus software detection and identification.</p>
		<p>In the fourth generation, great changes have been made in process hiding. The kernel insertion mode is adopted, and the remote insertion thread technology is used to embed DLL thread. Or link PSAPI, to achieve Trojan hiding, even in Windows NT/2000, have achieved a good hiding effect. Grey pigeons and bee thieves are more famous DLL Trojans.</p>
		<p>The fifth generation, drive class Trojan horse. Most of the driver Trojans use a large number of Rootkit technologies to achieve the effect of deep hiding, and go deep into the kernel space. After infection, they attack the antivirus software and the network firewall, and the system SSDT can be initialized. Causing the antivirus firewall to lose its effect. Some driver Trojans can reside in BIOS, and are difficult to kill.</p>
		<p>In the sixth generation, with the rise of active defense of identity authentication UsbKey and antivirus software, the Trojan horse of armyworm technology type and special reflection technology type began to systematize gradually. The former is mainly about stealing and tampering with user sensitive information, while the latter is mainly about dynamic password and hard certificate attack. PassCopy and Dark Spider-Man are representatives of this type of Trojan horse.</p>
		
		<h2>Principle</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Trojan horse virus is usually based on the computer network, is based on the client and server communication, monitoring programs. The client program is used for hacker remote control, can issue control commands, receive information from the server. The server program runs on the controlled computer, generally hidden in the controlled computer, can receive the commands sent by the client and execute, send back the information needed by the client, that is, the Trojan horse program.</p>
		<p>The necessary condition for Trojan virus attack is that the client and server must establish network communication, which is based on IP address and port number. Once the Trojan program hidden on the server side is triggered, it will continue to send the IP address and port number of the communication to the client. The client uses the IP address and port number of the server Trojan to establish a communication link between the client and the server. Client hackers can use this communication link to control the server computer.</p>
		<p>The Trojan program running on the server first hides its whereabouts, disguises it as a legal communication program, and then sets the trigger conditions by modifying the system registry to ensure that it can be executed. And you can constantly monitor the contents of the registry. Find that your registry has been deleted or modified and can be repaired automatically.</p>
		
		<h2>Species</h2>
		<hr />
		<h3><b>1. Trojan for online Game</b></h3>
		<p>With the popularity and heating up of online games, China has a large number of online game players. The boundary between virtual wealth and real wealth in online games, such as money and equipment, is becoming more and more blurred. At the same time, in order to steal the password of the online game account for the purpose of the Trojan virus has also developed flooding.</p>
		<p>Online game Trojan usually records the user's keyboard input, Hook game process API function and other methods to obtain the user's password and account. The stolen information is usually sent to the Trojan author by sending an email or submitting it to a remote script program. The type and number of online game Trojans are second to none in domestic Trojan viruses. Popular online games are all threatened by online gaming Trojans. After a new game is officially released, it is often within a week or two that the corresponding Trojan horse program will be made. The public sale of a large number of Trojan horse generators and hacker websites is also one of the reasons for the proliferation of online gaming Trojans.</p>
		<h3><b>2. Net Silver Trojan</b></h3>
		<p>Net silver Trojan horse is aimed at the online trading system Trojan horse virus, its purpose is to steal the user's card number, password, and even security certificate. Although the number of such Trojan horse species is not as good as the online game Trojan horse, but its harm is more direct, the loss of the victim user is more heavy.</p>
		<p>The net silver Trojan horse is usually targeted, the Trojan horse author may first carry on the careful analysis to a bank's online trading system, and then write the virus program for the security weak link. In 2013, security software PC manager intercepted the latest variety of net silver Trojan horse "Bima Wen", Bima Wen virus can modify the payment interface without trace, so that users can not be aware of it. It spreads widely through the fake QVOD download address provided by the bad website. When the user downloads the hanging horse player file and installs it, the Trojan horse will become a Trojan horse. After the virus runs, it will begin to monitor the user's network transactions, blocking balance payments and quick payments. Force users to use online banking, and take the opportunity to tamper with orders and steal property.</p>
		<p>With the popularity of online trading in China, the number of users threatened by foreign online silver Trojans is also increasing.</p>
		<h3><b>3. Download Types</b></h3>
		<p>This Trojan program is generally very small, its function is to download other virus programs from the network or install advertising software. Because of its small size, download Trojans are easier to spread and spread faster. Usually powerful, the volume is also very large after the class virus, such as "gray pigeon", "black hole" and so on, spread when writing a small download Trojan horse, the user will download the back door main program to run on this machine after poisoning.</p>
		<h3><b>4. Agent Types</b></h3>
		<p>After the user is infected with the agent Trojan horse, the proxy service functions such as HTTP, SOCKS and so on will be enabled on this machine. Hackers use the infected computer as a springboard to carry out hacking activities as infected users to achieve the purpose of hiding themselves.</p>
		<h3><b>5. FTP Trojan</b></h3>
		<p>The FTP Trojan opens port 21 of the controlled computer (the default port used by FTP) so that everyone can use an FTP client program to connect to the controlled computer without a password. And can carry on the highest authority upload and download, steal the victim's confidential files. The new FTP Trojan also adds a password function so that only the attacker himself knows the correct password and enters the other's computer</p>
		<h3><b>6. Communication Software</b></h3>
		<p>There are generally three types of instant messaging Trojans:</p>
		<p>(1) message sending type</p>
		<p>Messages containing malicious URLs are automatically sent through instant messaging software in order to allow users who receive messages to click on the URL to be poisoned, and after poisoning, users will send virus messages to more friends. A common technique for such viruses is to search the chat window, which in turn controls the window to automatically send text content. Send message Trojan horse often acts as an advertisement of online game Trojan horse, such as "Wuhan boy 2005" Trojan horse, can send virus website through MSN, QQ, UC and other chat software, its main function is to steal account number and password of legendary game.</p>
		<p>(2) Theft account type</p>
		<p>The main goal is the login account and password of the instant messaging software. The working principle is similar to the online game Trojan horse. After virus authors steal other people's accounts, they may peek at private content such as chat records, send bad information, advertising and other statements to friends in a variety of communication software, or sell their accounts to make a profit.</p>
		<p>(3) Spreading self-type</p>
		<p>In early 2005, after a spate of MSN-transmitted worms such as MSN Sexy Chicken, MSN introduced a new version that banned users from sending executables. In the first half of 2005, the two domestic viruses, "QQ tortoise" and "QQ love bug", spread by themselves through QQ chat software, infecting a large number of users. Jiangmin ranked first and fourth on the top ten viruses in the first half of 2005. From the technical point of view, the QQ worm that sends the file class is the evolution of the QQ Trojan horse that sent the message before. The basic technology used is to control the chat window after searching the chat window to achieve the purpose of sending files or messages. It's just that the operation of sending a file is much more complicated than sending a message.</p>
		<p><b>7. Page Click Category</b></p>
		<p>Web click Trojan horse will maliciously simulate users click on advertising and other actions, in a short period of time can produce tens of thousands of clicks. Virus authors are generally written to earn high advertising costs. The technology of this type of virus is simple and usually just sends a HTTP GET request to the server.</p>
		
		<h2>Characteristics</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>(1) Concealment</p>
		<p>The main factor that Trojan can exist for a long time is that it can hide itself and disguise itself as a legitimate application, which makes it difficult for users to identify, which is the primary and important feature of Trojan horse virus. Like other viruses, the duration of this concealment is often longer. The methods often used are parasitic in legal programs, modified to legal program names or icons, do not produce any icons, do not appear in the process or disguised as system processes and associated with other legitimate files, and so on.</p>
		<p>(2) Deceptive</p>
		<p>The main means of concealment of Trojan viruses is deception. Camouflage is often used to legalize oneself. For example, use the legal file type suffixes "dll, sys,ini'', and so on; use the existing legal system file name, and then save it in another file directory;" Use confusing characters such as the letters "o" and the number "0", the number "1" and the letter "I".</p>
		<p>(3) Stubbornness</p>
		<p>Trojan horse virus in order to ensure that they can continue to spread, often like a tumor residing in the infected computer, there are multiple backup files, once the main file is deleted, it can be restored immediately. In particular, the use of file association technology, as long as the associated program is executed, the Trojan horse virus will be executed, and produce new Trojan horse programs, or even variants. The stubborn Trojan virus brings great difficulties to the removal of Trojans.</p>
		<p>(4) Harmfulness</p>
		<p>There is no doubt about the harmfulness of the Trojan horse virus. As long as the computer is infected by Trojan horse virus, hackers with ulterior motives can operate the computer at will, just like using the computer locally, the destruction of the controlled computer can be imagined. Hackers can be arbitrary, can steal important resources of the system, such as: system password, stock trading information. Confidential data, etc.</p>
		
		<h2>Transmission Mode</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>There are many ways of transmission of Trojan horse virus, mainly:</p>
		<p>(1) using the download to spread, enter the program in the process of download, when the download is finished opening the file, the virus will be implanted into the computer;</p>
		<p>(2) when there is a vulnerability in the computer, it becomes the object of Trojan horse virus attack by using the system vulnerability to spread;</p>
		<p>(3) using mail to spread, many strange emails are mixed with virus seeds, once the mail is opened, the virus is activated;</p>
		<p>(4) spread by remote connection;</p>
		<p>(5) using the web page to spread, when browsing the web page, there will often appear a lot of pop-up pages, this kind of page is the place where the virus is stationed;</p>
		<p>(6) using worm virus to spread and so on.</p>
		
		<h2>Camouflage Mode</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>In view of the harmfulness of the Trojan, many people still have a certain understanding of Trojan horse knowledge, which has a certain inhibitory effect on the spread of Trojan horses, which is what Trojan horse designers do not want to see, so they have developed a variety of functions to camouflage Trojan horses. In order to achieve the purpose of reducing user alertness and deceiving users.</p>
		<p>1. Modify icon</p>
		<p>When you see this icon in the attachment to E-MAIL, do you think it's a text file? But I have to tell you, this could also be a Trojan horse. There is already a Trojan horse that can change the icon of the Trojan horse server program into the icon of various files such as HTML,TXT,ZIP, which is quite confusing. But Trojans that provide this function are rare, and this camouflage is not impeccable, so you don't have to be scared and paranoid all day.</p>
		<p>2. Bundling files</p>
		<p>This camouflage means that the Trojan horse is bundled to an installer, when the installer runs, the Trojan horse in the user unaware of the situation, secretly entered the system. As for bundled files, they are generally executables (that is, files such as EXE,COM).</p>
		<p>3. Error display</p>
		<p>People with a certain knowledge of Trojans know that if you open a file without any reaction, it is likely to be a Trojan horse program, and the Trojan horse designer is also aware of this defect. So there is already a Trojan horse that provides a feature called error display. When the server user opens the Trojan, an error prompt box will pop up (which is false, of course). The content of the error can be freely defined, and most of it will be customized to something such as "the file is corrupted and cannot be opened!" Such information, when the server users believe that, Trojans have quietly invaded the system.</p>
		<p>4. Custom port</p>
		<p>Many old-fashioned Trojan horse ports are fixed, which brings convenience to judge whether the Trojan horse is infected or not. Just check the specific port to know what Trojan horse is infected, so many new Trojan horses have added the function of custom port. The control end user can choose any port between 1024 and 65535 as the Trojan port (generally do not choose the port below 1024), which brings trouble to judge the type of infected Trojan horse.</p>
		<p>5. Self-destruction</p>
		<p>This feature is designed to make up for a flaw in Trojans. We know that when a server user opens a file containing a Trojan, the Trojan copies itself to the WINDOWS system folder (under the C:WINDOWS or C:WINDOWSSYSTEM directory). Generally speaking, the size of the original Trojan horse file and the Trojan horse file in the system folder is the same (except for the Trojan horse that bundles the file), then the friend who is in the Trojan horse only needs to find the original Trojan horse file in the received letter and the downloaded software. Then according to the size of the original Trojan horse to the system folder to find the same size of the file, determine which is the Trojan horse on the line. The Trojan horse self-destruction function is that after the installation of the Trojan horse, the original Trojan horse file will be automatically destroyed, so that server users will be very difficult to find the source of the Trojan horse, in the absence of Trojan horse tools to help, it is difficult to delete the Trojan.</p>
		<p>6. Change the name of Trojan</p>
		<p>The file name of the Trojan horse installed to the system folder is generally fixed, so as long as according to some articles to kill the Trojan horse, follow the clues to find a specific file in the system folder, you can determine what Trojan horse is in. So there are a lot of Trojans allow control-side users to freely customize the installed Trojan horse file name, so it is difficult to determine the type of Trojan horse infection.</p>
		
		<h2>Harm</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>Trojan directly destroys the computer by rewriting the disk and destroying the computer database, which brings inconvenience to the user. When the Trojan horse destroys the program, the program can not run, which has a serious impact on the overall operation of the computer. Other Trojans can be carried out through the boot area of the disk, and the virus has a strong replication function, passing the user program to the external linker. You can also change the disk boot area to cause data formation channel damage. The virus also preempts the system resources through a large number of replication, interferes with the running environment of the system, and affects the running speed of the computer system.</p>
		<p>With the development of the Internet industry, Trojans like e-commerce, hang some Trojan horse programs on some online shopping, when users click, it is easy to enter the user system, when users use network banking. Stealing bank passwords through the Internet, and then stealing users' finances, causing huge economic losses to computer users. In some special areas, Trojans are used as means of attack, such as politics, military, finance, transportation and many other fields, become a battlefield without smoke of gunpowder, using Trojans to invade each other, obtain relevant information or carry on destruction.</p>
		
		<h2>Trojan Prevention</h2>
		<hr />
		<p>1. Detect and find the hidden location of the Trojan</p>
		<p>Trojan intrusion system, need to find a safe place to choose the appropriate time to attack, understand and master the Trojan horse hiding location, in order to finally remove the Trojan horse. Trojans are often integrated into programs, hidden in the system, disguised as ordinary files or added to the registry in the computer operating system, as well as embedded in boot files, once the computer starts, these Trojans will also run.</p>
		<p>2. Guard port</p>
		<p>Check what ports the computer uses, which ports are in normal use, and which ports are not open properly, understand the status of the computer ports, which ports are currently connected, and pay special attention to whether this opening is normal. Look at the current situation of data exchange, focusing on which data exchange is more frequent, whether it belongs to normal data exchange. Close some unnecessary ports.</p>
		<p>3. Remove suspicious programs</p>
		<p>For non-system programs, if not necessary, it can be deleted, if not sure, you can use some kill tools for detection.</p>
		<p>4. Install Firewall</p>
		<p>Firewall plays an irreplaceable role in the computer system, which ensures the data circulation of the computer and protects the safe channel of the computer. The management and control of the data can be customized according to the needs of users and prevent unnecessary data flow. Installing firewall is helpful to prevent and intercept computer virus Trojan horse program.</p>
		<p>5. Relevant departments should strengthen the regulation of Trojan horse industry chain and perfect the corresponding laws and regulations</p>
		<p>At this stage, there are some professional service groups in China, the existence of these groups can form a relatively perfect Trojan horse industry chain. Compared with the social security law, the enterprise management department for computer security should also be valued and managed by the relevant departments and subjects, and it is necessary to establish corresponding and sound legal measures. In 2017, the number of malicious infections on computers in China has decreased by 26%, and the number of malicious programs on the mobile Internet has gradually shown a downward trend. It is precisely because of the implementation of the "Network Security Law", to a certain extent, suppressed the problem of malicious programs disturbing the people, the promulgation of the laws and regulations, from the network point of view, strengthened the construction of some basic network facilities. Therefore, under the Internet environment, we must rely on the cooperation of the whole industrial chain, strengthen the management of each production line, so that the "Network Security Law" can play its due value.</p>
		<p>6. Improve the management of websites and online games</p>
		<p>Website and online game developers should increase the management and supervision of websites and online games, and strive to stop the Trojan horse virus from the source, so that it does not have the opportunity to spread, which is one of the main ways to prevent web viruses and online games. In addition, the daily maintenance, maintenance, and management of the network environment and equipment should be strengthened, including the daily inspection of the server on the website, the updating of the data and data in the server, the operation, the verification of the behavior log, and so on. It is also necessary to strictly check the network configuration and security configuration of the server.</p>
		<p>7. Increase the awareness of prevention among netizens</p>
		<p>China's computer users are growing rapidly, some users do not have a strong awareness of the protection of their own information, most users do not have some anti-virus software installed on their computers, or set up firewalls. They should be deeply aware that anti-virus is a long-term and systematic work, take the initiative to understand the relevant knowledge in this area, and improve the prevention measures for Trojan virus. In view of the virus problem carried in the website, the user can also use the firewall to steal the user account, privacy before the Trojan horse, intercept and annihilate it.</p>
